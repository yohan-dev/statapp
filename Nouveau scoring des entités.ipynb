      " Evo Morales became the first indigenous president of Bolivia in 2006 after a landmark election victory broke decades of domination by an elite largely of European or mixed descent.\n",
      " Around 36 indigenous languages are officially recognised -- including Quechua, Aymara and Guarani -- along with an indigenous legal system different to state law.\n",
      " Morales had been the region's longest-serving leader, credited with bringing relative stability to a volatile country.\n",
      " After election on October 20, 2019, the electoral authorities once again declared Morales the winner with 47 percent of ballots. But the result was disputed, leading to weeks of protests in which three people were killed and more than 250 injured.\n",
      " Bolivia has a history of political instability. Since independence in 1825, there have been about 200 coups or attempted coups. Between 1978 and 1982, there were nine different governments. \n",
      " Bolivia's economic growth has outstripped most of its regional neighbours, reaching 4.2 percent in 2018 according to the World Bank.\n",
      " The state also controls telecommunications, pensions, hydroelectric power stations, airports and mining, using much of the money to fund social programmes and public infrastructure.\n",

      " Bolivia lost its prized route to the Pacific Ocean in a 19th century war with Chile and now sits landlocked, bordered by Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile and Peru.\n",
      " La Paz is the highest capital city in the world, at 3,900 metres (12,800 feet) above sea level, and the Andes mountain range covers a third of Bolivian territory.\n",
