http://cnn.com,"80 million Chinese may already be out of work. 9 million more will soon be competing for jobs, too","The 26-year old tech worker spent the last year jumping from one startup to another in what already felt like a precarious job market . But when he was laid off again in January, this time from a Beijing-based internet company, he never expected things to become as difficult as they are

Last year ""already felt like living in a hell mode,"" Wang told CNN Business in a telephone interview. ""But 2020 is even worse. The coronavirus is like a head-on blow.""

Wang is not his full name. He asked CNN Business to not use his entire name because he didn't want friends or family to know the details of his unemployment — a fear echoed by others in China who spoke about losing their jobs. Some also voiced concerns that making their personal predicament public could hurt their chances of finding work.

The pandemic all but shut down China for several weeks this year, wreaking havoc on the world's second largest economy and forcing millions of people out of work.

The full scale of how many people have lost their jobs in the country is hard to capture. Data from Beijing is notoriously opaque, and the official unemployment rate — which only tracks jobless numbers in urban areas — has barely moved beyond 4% to just over 5% for years.

But even the official tally has started to register a spike. Unemployment in March was 5.9%, just shy of the record 6.2% reported a month earlier. That would represent more than 27 million people out of work, according to a CNN Business calculation using government data.

""China's unemployment could be seriously understated,"" said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor for the Center of China Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong . ""It's unusual they are willing to report that bad data. Given the government often massages the figures, the real situation must be worse.""

An 'unprecedented' problem

Beijing's data, after all, does not include people in rural communities or a large number of the 290 million migrant workers who work in construction, manufacturing and other low paying but vital activities. If those migrants are included, as many as 80 million people could have been out of work at the end of March, according to an article co-authored last month by Zhang Bin, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a think tank run by the government.

Other experts say that the 80 million figure is likely much closer to reality. It's also a lot more disturbing — it would mean that nearly 10% of people in China who are supposed to be employed are actually out of work, according to economists at Société Générale.

""The Covid-19 shock to the job market is unprecedented in its scale, length and nature,"" wrote Wei Yao and Michelle Lam in a research report last week.

The Ministry of Commerce did not respond to a request from CNN Business for comment on this story. Speaking last month, a spokesman for China's National Bureau of Statistics acknowledged that the labor market was under a lot of pressure, but he insisted overall employment was ""stable.""

""Although the coronavirus has had a severe impact [on jobs], there are no massive layoffs in the country,"" Mao Shengyong said at a press conference.

But Beijing is bracing for additional pain in the coming months. A record number of people are graduating from universities this year, which will put more pressure on the job market. And while the economy may still eke out some growth in 2020, its road to a full recovery will likely be a long one.

The Chinese government has never been candid about its economic woes. But recent messaging from officials has made it clear that unemployment is a big problem.

Economic growth was already the weakest in decades before the outbreak pushed the country into its first contraction since 1976, when Communist Party leader Mao Zedong's death ended a decade of social and economic tumult.

Shoring up the economy — and preventing the jobless rate from spiraling out of control — has only gotten more critical in recent months. In April, the Communist Party's Politburo, its top ruling body, told all government officials to prioritize job security and social stability above anything else, according to the state news agency Xinhua.

Getting people back to work is important in part because authorities fear a wave of unemployment could lead to social unrest, creating a massive political headache, according to Lam, the Chinese University of Hong Kong professor.

""Beijing's biggest concern is not GDP growth, but employment,"" he said.

'I feel miserable'

Job seekers aren't optimistic that the situation will improve soon. Wang, the tech worker from Beijing, said it seems life is tough for everyone right now.

""I feel miserable, but I can't do anything about it,"" he said. ""I don't think anyone can.""

Wang said the current environment contrasts starkly to when he graduated from college in 2015. Beijing at that time was offering subsidies and other forms of financial support to startups, which encouraged entrepreneurs to create millions of new companies. The unemployment rate that year was about 5%.

Even before the coronavirus outbreak, Wang said offers were drying up. The tech startups he worked at in 2018 and 2019 ran out of cash as Beijing tightened regulations on how they could obtain investment.

But now he says finding work is almost impossible. He and his friends have started lowering their expectations, and some of them aren't even sure whether they can stay in Beijing.

""There were already signs last year [of mass unemployment], but this year it's getting worse, "" Wang said. ""I don't know when things will turn better ... I'll just wait.""

There is evidence that it's gotten tougher to find work. Job vacancies plunged 28% in the first three months of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of last year, according to a recent survey by the China Institute for Employment Research and Zhaopin.com, one of China's largest job sites. Competition, meanwhile, was fiercer: The number of job seekers jumped nearly 9% in the first quarter, the survey showed.

And companies in China's services sector — which accounts for almost half of all jobs in the country — shed workers at a record rate in April, according to survey data released Thursday by media group Caixin and research firm Markit.

""I feel that the job market is shrinking at a rapid pace,"" said Yi Feng, 32, who lost his job in March at a logistics firm in Shanghai. Yi requested that CNN Business use an alias for him, which he chose, adding that he feared talking openly about his troubles would amount to burning bridges with potential employers. ""It's extremely difficult to find a job now, because most companies have frozen their hiring since the end of March.""

An influx of job seekers

The landscape might get even more difficult in the coming weeks. Beijing expects about 8.7 million people will graduate from colleges and universities this year, creating even more competition for work.

""Leading up to my graduation, I had my mind set on becoming a journalist. But this year it is really too hard,"" said Andrea Yao, a 22-year-old senior at the Communication University of China in Beijing. She said she was supposed to interview with a newspaper in Wuxi last month, but couldn't go because she couldn't obtain the ""health code"" required to enter the city.

Yao told CNN Business that she reached out to 61 companies about jobs, but only five asked for her resume. Many companies wanted candidates who already had experience.

Recently, ""when I was taking the subway to [an internship], I suddenly felt a burst of anxiety through my heart when I thought of the fact that I haven't settled on a job,"" she said.

Others said the coronavirus has disrupted their plans. Li Cuiyu, who is graduating from the Beijing-based China Agriculture University with a master's degree, said she wanted to become a civil servant so she could obtain a highly coveted ""hukou,"" or household registration permit, in the Chinese capital. But the annual exam required for that work was postponed because of the outbreak.

While Li is weighing other options — she had been looking for jobs at foreign companies in Beijing, for example — that hasn't been easy, either.

""There are simply not many recruitment ads out there, and some foreign companies are already laying off staff,"" she said.

A job applicant makes a call at an on-site job fair in Wuhan last month. The landscape for job hunters might get even more difficult in the coming weeks as about 8.7 million people graduate from colleges and universities.

Aid from the top

Beijing is aware of the looming wave of new job seekers. The government this week unveiled a plan to help new graduates find jobs as teachers and create other ""grassroots level"" positions, according to Xinhua . The project also includes a proposal to expand enrollment in postgraduate programs.

But authorities still have a tough task ahead of them as they try to help others who have lost their jobs.

""A particular concern is that the safety net doesn't catch the most vulnerable,"" wrote Mark Williams, chief Asia economist for Capital Economics, in a recent research note.

All employers in China are legally required to provide unemployment insurance. But less than half of the urban labor force was covered by that program at the end of last year, according to data from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security. And experts, including the economists at Société Générale, have noted that the program is ill-equipped to deal with the massive surge in jobless figures.

The government seems to have recognized these issues, Williams added, since it recently pledged to help those without jobs access insurance.

But other experts have pointed out that there are other challenges facing Beijing as it tries to push its citizens back to work.

China is already struggling with mounting debt , which makes it tough to spend more on infrastructure projects that could create more jobs, according to Joseph Cheng, a democracy activist and a retired professor of political science at the City University of Hong Kong. Chinese state media has suggested recently that regional governments could invest $1.1 trillion in roads, airports and other projects, but those funds haven't actually been set aside yet and it's not clear whether such targets could be reached.

Several experts have said that policymakers in China should put more effort toward ensuring that people can meet their basic, daily needs. The Société Générale economists, for example, said a ""more direct but audacious measure"" would be to give cash directly to low income households, so as to circumvent the need for an unemployment insurance program.

Even Zhang, the state think tank economist, floated a similar proposal. He said the government's response to the economic fallout from the virus — which totals tens of billions of dollars in financial relief and stimulus — should include cash handouts for the poor."

Priyanka Chopra is an actress, producer, philanthropist, singer and former Miss World. And, as has become evident in recent seasons, she is also a style icon.

Chopra's aesthetic has evolved over the past few years, transforming her from girl next door to fashion queen, both on and off the red carpet.

Red carpet queen

Chopra's style is bold, polished and glamorous. Nowhere is that more evident than on the red carpet.

In the US, Chopra started gravitating towards more relaxed fits and international designers, embracing retro jumpsuits and edgier leather looks. But it wasn't until 2016, that her fashion credentials crystallized.

That year saw the star wearing one flawless outfit after the other -- a glam embellished white strapless gown by Lebanese designer Zuhair Murad at her maiden Oscars ceremony; a cerulean Atelier Versace stunner at the Billboard Music Awards; and a sharp white suit by ST.studio by Olcay Gulsen at the Time 100 Gala.

Chopra has also repeatedly shown she's unafraid of taking risks.

For her Met Gala debut in 2017, Chopra wore custom-made Ralph Lauren trench coat with a dramatic collar and sweeping train. She followed it up in 2018 with an intricate beaded headdress.

Then, last year , she matched a feathery silver-and-pastel gown by Dior, with frizzled hair, silver-frosted brows and raspberry eyeshadow.

At the Golden Globes in 2017, she wore a body-hugging gold dress by Ralph Lauren. ""It's my first time at the Golden Globes, so I wanted to be the golden globe,"" she told Vogue's US edition . For her first Cannes Film Festival last year, she wore a dreamy white tulle Georges Hobeika tiered gown, which was actually a wedding dress.

""She is like an artist; you can see she has fun with it and doesn't like to get lost in a crowd,"" Chopra's US stylist, Cristian Ehrlich, told Vogue India of her style. ""She likes to use her voice and fashion to express her different moods.""

Off-duty cool

Impressing on the red carpet is one thing, but repeatedly turning heads with your fashion is another altogether. And the 37-year-old has done so while experimenting with trends, making them a louder, bolder, bigger versions of themselves.

Last year's monochrome look? She nailed it, and then elevated it to new heights with a series of head-to-toe one-tone ensembles in shades of bright pink, turquoise and mint.

The floral prints that were all over the spring-summer 2018 and 2019 collections, from Marni to Loewe? They turned up riotously in Chopra's wardrobe. As did the '70s aesthetic seen at Gucci, Anna Sui and Alberta Ferretti.

Chopra has also combined clashing items, like a velvet bomber jacket and wool tweed palazzo pants, and stepped out in stunning dresses complete with fringing and a thigh-high splits.

Celebrating Indian fashion

While she's made her love for couture and international brands clear, Chopra has also embraced designers from her native India.

Since the start of her career, the actress has proudly shown off her roots by supporting and showcasing Indian designers, from more established names like Sabyasachi, Anita Dongre and Manish Malhotra -- all fashion powerhouses in India -- to up-and-coming talents, like Masaba Gupta.

In February, she walked the finale of India's Blenders Pride Fashion Tour, an annual event that scouts new talents in association with the Fashion Design Council of India, to show her support for local creatives.

But her Indian ancestry shone the brightest at her lavish five-day nuptials to Jonas, when she sported one elaborate traditional Indian dress after the other. They included a silver beaded lehenga from label Falguni Shane Peacock that took 12,000 hours of work, and a red one by designer Sabyasachi, stitched by 110 embroiderers.

Chopra's enthusiasm for diverse looks that span cultures makes her a style icon worth watching -- at home and on the red carpet."

Dietrick said that even through the headphones he was wearing he could hear someone inside the bathroom who sounded ""distraught.""

That's when the three Marines gathered outside the restroom while a flight attendant unlocked the door, according to the release. Once it was open, the Marines restrained the passenger with flex ties.

""I knew I had to step in when he became a danger to others and himself,"" Meinhardt said. ""I didn't think twice about helping restrain him through the rest of the flight.""

http://cnn.com,A 'travel bubble' between New Zealand and Australia could be a model for the future,"Wellington, New Zealand (CNN) — It may be some time before tourists are traveling the globe again. But what if you could travel through designated, approved parts of it?

and New Zealand are discussing the possibility of opening up borders to each other, creating a travel corridor -- or ""travel bubble"" -- between the two nations. Politicians from Australia and New Zealand are discussing the possibility of opening up borders to each other, creating a travel corridor -- or ""travel bubble"" -- between the two nations.

""If there is any country in the world with whom we can reconnect with first, undoubtedly that's New Zealand,"" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said last month.

""That is a situation we would all like to be in, but of course, our number one focus at the moment is making sure that both our countries are in the position where we're domestically managing Covid-19 to a point where we can with confidence open borders,"" New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on April 27.

""One thing I'm not willing to do is jeopardize the position that New Zealand has got itself into by moving too soon to open our borders -- even to Australia.""

It's not clear when this ""bubble"" could become a reality -- currently both countries still have domestic travel restrictions in place, and all international arrivals are subject to a 14-day quarantine.

Travel industry experts say August is when the corridor is likely to be rolled out, possibly in time for the ski season in New Zealand and the school holidays in September.

A special relationship

There are a few reasons why New Zealand and Australia would be each other's first pick.

Although the two countries are separated by about 2,000 km (1,243 miles) of sea, they have one of the closest bilateral relationships in the world. Australian passport holders can travel and work in New Zealand indefinitely without a visa, and vice versa.

The two countries also contribute heavily to each other's tourism industry.

Australians make up almost 40% of international arrivals to New Zealand, and around 24% of New Zealand's international visitor spend. That's especially significant in New Zealand, where tourism is the country's biggest export industry . (Tourism is considered an export industry because it involves foreign cash being used to buy New Zealand's goods and services.)

Over in Australia, New Zealanders make up around 15% of the country's international visitors, and only about 6% of the international visitor spend. Tourism is still worth billions to Australia, although it is only the country's fourth biggest export industry

In both countries, tourism industries have taken a massive hit from the coronavirus outbreak -- so it's no surprise that industry representatives are welcoming the prospect of a travel bubble.

""The message from the industry side is that the bubble is a goer,"" said Simon Westaway, the executive director of the Australian Tourism Industry Council, adding that it was the only way of getting international tourism into Australia in the near future.

""If we can add in the Australians, that would be enormously beneficial for the survival of tourism businesses and thousands of jobs,"" said Chris Roberts, the chief executive of Tourism Industry Aotearoa, which represents the tourism industry in New Zealand. He added that the amount tourists spend in New Zealand had dropped by at least 2 billion New Zealand dollars ($1.22 billion) a month.

But Roberts isn't expecting the levels of Australian tourists that New Zealand had pre-Covid -- he thinks many would opt to just travel domestically.

In Australia, some tour operators had been focusing their attention on China, which makes up about 15% of travelers to Australia but 27% of total tourist spend. Westaway said those businesses would need to adapt and work out how to appeal to more Kiwi travelers.

How would it work?

would need to undergo a One thing to keep in mind: Australia is made up of states and territories, and some of those currently have additional quarantine rules in place. For instance, a person traveling from Sydney (in New South Wales) to Brisbane (in Queensland)would need to undergo a 14-day self-quarantine period

Airports may also need to roll out new procedures.

Roberts envisions a future where tourists may turn up to the airport, be tested for Covid-19 and only be allowed on the plane once they've got a negative result. Once they are at their destination, they may have their temperature checked. Travelers may need to supply more information than usual so they can be easily traced, if necessary.

Both Roberts and Westaway believe the bubble would only work if the current 14-day quarantine period for anyone entering the country is removed.

Once the trans-Tasman bubble is tried and tested, New Zealand could look to include other territories in its bubble -- perhaps Taiwan and Hong Kong, Roberts said.

""I think it will be on a country by country basis,"" he said. ""A general opening of borders could be a very long time away.""

Could the bubble get bigger?

For the first time, drones have been allowed to fly inside Kakadu National Park in Australia. The resulting video is stunning.

There's also some discussion about broadening the bubble to include the Pacific Islands.

From a health perspective, the Pacific Island nations appear to have escaped the coronavirus outbreak largely unscathed. Fiji -- the worst affected Pacific Island nation -- has reported only 18 coronavirus cases and no deaths. Guam -- which is a US territory and not a nation -- has reported more than 140 coronavirus cases and five deaths

Many Pacific Island nations closed borders early to protect against potential spread.

But the pandemic has hurt tourism to the Pacific Islands, one of the most aid-dependent regions in the world

Ardern has urged caution on including the Pacific, saying: ""Our Pacific neighbors in large part have not been afflicted by Covid-19, and the last thing we would want is to risk that.""

But broadening Australia and New Zealand's travel bubble to at least some Pacific Islands would help boost the islands' tourism industry, said Stephen Howes, the director of the Development Policy Center at Australian National University in Canberra.

""For a lot of people, it's very tough,"" he said of the effect on tourism in the Pacific. ""Some have gone back to their village ... people are just struggling to get by.""

""Obviously no country would be forced to do this,"" he said, adding that the travel corridor could always be stopped if it didn't work. ""It would be a complex undertaking ... but it's certainly worth trying.""

Related content The world's most powerful passports in the age of coronavirus

And including the Pacific would also help Australia and New Zealand, allowing migrant workers to enter both countries. The inclusion could also have a huge soft power impact in the region, which is of strategic importance to New Zealand, Australia and China.

""This is a real test,"" Howes said. ""If Australia and New Zealand go ahead and just have a trans-Tasman partnership, they could really antagonize the Pacific. It would be like, 'well you don't really care.'""

Roberts agreed that the bubble would benefit the Pacific, saying that without tourism, their economies are in significant trouble.

""In terms of economic aid to our Pacific neighbors, that would be the best thing we could do for them -- as long as we could do it safely.""

Is this the future of travel?

A potential Australia and New Zealand travel bubble may end up being a model for the rest of the world, Roberts and Westaway say.

Like other countries around the world, New Zealand and Australia will need to be careful not to move too fast and create a second Covid-19 wave.

Moving too fast could also jeopardize their image with international tourists, who view the countries as clean, trustworthy places.

But generally, Roberts and Westaway are hopeful.

""If (the detail) can be worked out between New Zealand and Australia, then they can be applied to other places as well,"" Roberts said."
http://cnn.com,Get ready for a campaign season full of China-Covid conspiracy theories,"Stephen Roach, a faculty member at Yale University and former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, is the author of the 2014 book ""Unbalanced: The Codependency of America and China."" The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) Attacking China has now become the centerpiece for the upcoming 2020 election campaign by an increasingly desperate Republican Party and its vulnerable leadership.

A leaked 57-page "" Corona Big Book "" -- reportedly disseminated by the GOP's Senate-campaign arm, produced by a consulting firm, and obtained by Politico -- urges GOP candidates to bash China between now and November. It rests on three premises: that the novel coronavirus came from a lab in Wuhan, that the Chinese government covered up the outbreak and that the Trump administration would have acted forcefully had it only known the real ""truth.""

The first claim is dubious; the next, ambiguous; and the third one, not credible.

First, notwithstanding the insistence of President Trump and his loyalists, investigative reporting by award-winning journalists, as well as intelligence assessments by the governments of Australia, the UK and Canada , have found no evidence that the virus spilled from a lab.

This is the latest in a long string of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that the President has embraced over the years. From the Obama birther accusations and claims of a Ukrainian server as a repository for Hillary Clinton's emails to America's ""deep state"" and the hoax of global warning, Trump talk is double-talk for a president who traffics in misinformation.

Fact-checkers at The Washington Post now count at least 18,000 false or misleading claims by President Trump in his first 1,170 days in office (running through April 14, 2020).

Second, China certainly did mishandle the outbreak of Covid-19. How much responsibility lies with the Wuhan municipal government , or the central government in Beijing, is clouded in ambiguity. But one thing is clear: The chain of command failed. In the fateful month of December 2019, early signs of a deadly novel coronavirus became evident in Wuhan.

Dr. Li Wenliang, a whistleblower who was initially scorned but now revered, might have made a real difference had his warnings been heeded. He spoke out publicly on December 30, 2019 , ironically the same day virus samples were taken from patients in Wuhan. Sadly, Dr. Li passed away in early February.

Meanwhile, the virus was raging in Hubei Province and, it now seems plausible , spreading silently around the world in asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, or only mildly symptomatic people. Only a full and open accountability by China can sort this out.

Third, what did President Trump know, and when did he know it? US Sen. Howard Baker made that line famous in the Watergate hearings of 1973 in questioning the motives and role of President Richard Nixon in a cover-up that eventually forced him to resign in disgrace.

Investigative reporting has also indicated that considerable early warning evidence was available to US intelligence agencies on the coronavirus outbreak during December 2019 and January-February 2020. While President Trump is not exactly known to be a voracious consumer of intelligence reports contained in the President's Daily Brief, surely you would think that the professionals in the White House would take this information far more seriously.

Unfortunately, it seems that may not have been the case. (One key White House misstep came long before the virus would surface: In 2018, in a brilliant stroke of organizational genius predictably aimed at negating yet another of his predecessor's policies, the President disbanded the Global Health Security and Biodefense unit housed within the National Security Council that was set up following the Ebola epidemic of 2014.)

But the real questions pertain less to management blunders and more to the false narrative of Donald Trump as a magnanimous and decisive leader who, had he known of what was going on in China, would have behaved differently.

For a president who has taken no responsibility for an unending stream of misstatements about the virus -- from insisting in February at the onset of an exponential surge in infections and death that ""one day, it's like a miracle, it will disappear""; to advocating the use of untested ( hydroxychloroquine ) and dangerous (injection of disinfectants ) remedies; to misstating repeatedly that US coronavirus testing is the best in the world; to turning daily pandemic briefings into political combat -- this counter-factual is hardly credible.

In the end, the GOP's so-called ""Corona Big Book"" throws down the gauntlet in its campaign marching orders: ""... don't defend Trump ... attack China."" With the President's defense of his performance weak and getting weaker, the first point is obvious. And the weaker his position becomes, the more intense the attack.

That strategy resonates with polling which shows American public opinion is now more negative on China than ever before -- hardly surprising as a trade war has morphed into a pandemic war.

And, in what resembles a repeat of the impeachment saga, when Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani investigated unfounded allegations about the Bidens in Ukraine, The New York Times reports administration officials have pressed spy agencies to find the smoking gun in Wuhan that supports the theory that the virus emanated from a lab.

Both China and the US have clearly lacked transparency and accountability in their responses to Covid-19. But to turn the tragedy of this pandemic into the crass politics of a blame game is unconscionable. Another Cold War is bad enough . The combination of xenophobia and soaring unemployment is reminiscent of much more painful times in history. Look no farther than the 1930s.

Forty-six years ago, a Republican senator had the moral fortitude to ask of a Republican president: What did he know and when did he know it? Elections are ultimately about leadership and the character of those who purport to lead. November 3 is now less than six months away."

(CNN) Americans are staring down an unprecedented crisis. We've already lost more than 71,000 of our fellow citizens. Millions of families live in fear and uncertainty every second. And large swaths of our workforce are losing their jobs each week.

Together, we face a common, invisible enemy: the novel coronavirus, Covid-19.

As two former US Senate majority leaders , we didn't always see eye to eye during our time together in Congress, but today, we certainly agree on at least two things: America must lead the rest of the world to defeat Covid-19. And if we take our eye off the ball, China will try to exploit this crisis to its own gain.

Once again, Covid-19 has taught us that what happens around the world matters and impacts us here at home. As the number of cases climbs every time we refresh our screens, we're learning in real time that viral threats know no borders. After starting thousands of miles away in China late last year , Covid-19 has spread to virtually every continent

When 70% of the globe remains underprepared to respond to a public health emergency, it will require urgent action to both defeat Covid-19 -- and stop the next pandemic before it reaches our shores.

Congress, alongside the administration, has taken unprecedented steps to protect our citizens and our economy. This includes the multiple emergency funding bills passed in recent days . While there is certainly more we must do within our borders, it's also time we step up our fight on the global front.

As some of our nation's top retired military leaders recently stated , ""No matter how successful we are in fighting the threat of the Covid-19 pandemic at home, we will never stop it unless we are also fighting it around the world.""

The truth is that we have no choice but to help lead the world in confronting this threat wherever it emerges. No matter how long it takes us to defeat this virus in the US, it will most certainly arrive back at our doorstep -- surely leading to more deaths, lockdowns, and significant disruptions to our economy -- if we do not act globally.

After downplaying the threat to the world and failing to contain the initial Covid-19 outbreak within its own borders , Chinese officials have become increasingly generous with aid to Africa, South America, and Europe. Their global campaign -- along with that of Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma -- has ranged from deploying doctors, masks, and ventilators to Italy and France to donating supplies to every African nation.

To be sure, there have been a number of reports scrutinizing the effectiveness and motives of these efforts -- and we must recognize China's inaction and misinformation in reporting the gravity of Covid-19. But we should also take note of how Italy's EU ambassador, Maurizio Massari, lamented that not a single EU nation responded to Italy's request for medical equipment. ""Only China responded bilaterally,"" he stated

Beijing clearly understands the paramount importance of helping other nations defeat Covid-19 as it tries to rebrand its own image. Yet if we allow China to flex unchecked on the global stage, it will strive to push their influence wherever it can.

As one of the world's indispensable nations, the US must play a critical role in securing the world from current and future health threats. Fortunately, America's investments in global health through the State Department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis have laid the groundwork for what the US must now lead: a comprehensive global response

If we are going to be effective in stopping Covid-19 around the world, we must leverage new emergency resources alongside our global partners for critical investments in global health, infection prevention and control, testing and lab capacities, and health worker training.

Greater global engagement by our diplomats, USAID, and the new US International Development Finance Corporation will also be essential to fast-tracking America's economic recovery -- especially since more than 50% of US exports went to the developing world before Covid-19 struck. To safeguard American jobs, we'll also need to confront the dire humanitarian and economic consequences in emerging and developing markets.

As supply chains and global economic activity are reset by this crisis -- and Beijing plays to its state-led authoritarian strengths -- the investments we make today to fight this pandemic around the world will certainly pay dividends tomorrow in American lives saved and livelihoods protected.

Many are comparing the magnitude of this crisis to World War II or 9/11. We couldn't agree more because the stakes have rarely been higher for America and the world.

This is our moment to stop this threat, protect our homeland, and ensure a world shaped by American leadership for the next generation."

At a virtual court hearing on Monday, Olalekan Hameed was found guilty of murdering his mother's employer in 2018 and was sentenced to death by hanging.

A judge at a court in Lagos delivered the ruling to Hameed, who appeared remotely from prison via Zoom, along with his lawyer and prosecutors who also joined the hearing remotely, justice ministry spokesman Kayode Oyekanmi told CNN.

Hameed, who denied the charge, remains in prison, Oyekanmi said. CNN was trying to reach the suspect and his lawyer for comment.

http://cnn.com,"Ghana's lavish funerals can last up to seven days. Now, a centuries-old tradition has gone online","Accra, Ghana (CNN) Funerals are a big deal in Ghana and it is not uncommon, in some parts, for a ceremony to last up to seven days, drawing thousands of crowds adorned in flowing red and black robes and gold jewelry.

Some families even hire professional mourners to cry at the funeral of their loved one because ""it serves as a reward to the person who has died,"" says Adwoa Yeboah Agyei, who owns The Funeral Shop and Services, a franchise with locations across Accra.

Ghanaian funerals are heavily symbolic and rituals involved include giving offerings to the spirits of the ancestors and loud traditional dancing and drumming to accompany the dead on their journey.

Anguished families

But a centuries-old tradition has come to a halt.

Since Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo suspended all public gatherings in mid-March in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, burials have been limited to no more than 25 people in the West African nation.

Obed Ampadu-Asiamah's 73-year-old father, Daniel, passed away soon after the announcement following complications from a stroke.

Obed has been scrambling to make painful phone calls send notices informing attendees he could only invite 25 family members and friends. They originally expected 2,000 people and an official funeral has been postponed to a later date.

""We had to cut all the in-laws and the grandchildren. None were able to attend,"" he told CNN, his voice shaking.

""We could only provide six slots for members on my father's side of the family and three for members of his church.""

The large funeral home they rented to hold the ceremony was moved into a small, private chapel within the same venue.

Face masks concealed the anguish on the faces of mourners dressed in red and black, as they stood several feet apart with heads bowed in remembrance of a highly respected man, who established churches in parts of West Africa.

Livestreaming burials

At Transitions, Ghana's largest private funeral home, a once heavy flow of ceremonies now trickles at a slow pace.

Genevieve Carnelius, the general manager, stated that finances and operations have been badly affected, but says her priority now is to work with clients like Obed to remotely reschedule their loved ones' funerals to uncertain future dates.

The home currently offers online live streaming from their chapel, where Ampadu-Asiamah's burial service took place, and where mourners across the globe can view the ceremonies of their loved ones.

A tradition has emerged within this culture of ""proverb coffins"" (abebuu adekai), which pay tribute to the occupant with a personalized and often spectacular design. Hide Caption 1 of 18 Photos: Journey to the other side in style The roots – According to legend, the first abebuu adekai was created in the 1950s when a ""palanquin"" carriage was made for a tribal leader in the shape of a cocoa pod. But the leader died suddenly, and quick-thinking subjects buried him in the pod.



This inspired young carpenter Seth Kane Kwei to establish his own novelty coffin studio in the town of Teshie, and the The Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop (above) remains popular to this day. Hide Caption 2 of 18 Photos: Journey to the other side in style Maiden flight – One of the first creations of the workshop was this coffin for Kane Kwei's grandmother, who had never traveled in a plane but was fascinated by the new mode of transport.



Shortly after, a boat design was requested for a fisherman, and the practice was up and running.

Once a lucrative sector, businesses catering to funerals are reeling.

Maryam Abdullah is a fashion designer who sews traditional garments primarily for weddings and funerals.

In an empty shop once bustling with customers, she sighed as she explained how Covid-19 has affected her business.

""No one is coming. Even the people who have already brought cloths for me to sew have not returned to pick them up, said Maryam. She understands why, though. ""If this is what it takes to stop the spread of this coronavirus, I am okay.""

For now, she prefers her clients to stay at home because she feels more protected from contracting the virus herself, but it will only be a matter of time before funds run dry, she added.

A stray from traditional customs

Shaking hands with the family of the deceased is a deep-rooted tradition in many Ghanaian tribes that has taken place for hundreds of years and has become a mandatory part of ceremonies to show respect for the dead, says Queen Naa Tsotsoo Soyoo I, a Ghanaian Queen mother, who forms part of a powerful group of traditional women leaders.

She explained how significant the ban on mass funeral gatherings has affected the customs of such ceremonies.

""A significant part of funerals is bringing families together to embrace through handshakes, hugs and to mourn in close proximity of one another,"" said Queen Naa.

""The immediate implication of what is now taking place is that families will be unable to connect. This is something that has never happened in generations and it is definitely going to have a social impact.""

Coffin made and painted to resemble a mermaid for Ga tribal priestess of sea god carried by funeral guests.

Despite all the sudden changes to traditional practices at funerals, she acknowledged that certain inherent rites will never go away. For example, in Islam, the second largest religion practiced in Ghana, senior Muslim members of the community must recite Quranic verses over the deceased immediately after designated family members perform a ritual cleansing of the body.

The person must be buried within 24 hours of death.

""With all that is going on, the testament of a funeral will always be a view of how a person lived life and the core of every funeral is that the individual is sent off with respect and dignity,"" she added.

No one can predict how long the effects of Covid-19 will alter lives as we once knew it. But Queen Naa is certain of one thing thing. ""There will be many celebrations of life when this is all over."""

http://cnn.com,Photographer Kyle Weeks uses his medium to show that manhood in Africa is not a singular image,"Written by By Alix-Rose Cowie, CNN

When Kyle Weeks was growing up in Windhoek, Namibia, his father would watch the news every morning before work, and again at lunchtime. He'd then relay the headlines to his son: a perpetual cycle of bleak outlooks on Africa. ""There was never really any good news,"" Weeks remembers. Now, as a photographer, he's challenging that narrative by focusing his lens on the creativity of the continent's youth.

And it would seem that this perspective is resonating. In 2016, Weeks was honored at the Magnum Photography Awards for his 2015 series ""Palm Wine Collectors,"" which captures Makalani palm harvesters from the Kunene region of Namibia tapping palm trees to make a nourishing moonshine. That same year, he had a solo show at the National Art Gallery of Namibia.

Since then, Weeks has been exhibited everywhere from Red Hook Labs in Brooklyn to London's 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair and has landed commissions from the likes of Vogue Italia and the New York Times.

Spreading the 'Good News'

Over the past four years, Weeks has been regularly traveling to Accra, Ghana, for an ongoing body of work. What started as a loose investigation into Ghanaian manhood has evolved into a project that highlights the immense creativity of the city's young people.

On one of his early trips, Weeks organized a small fashion shoot with local models, who arrived with plastic shopping bags filled with their own clothes to wear. One bag, with ""Good News"" printed on the side, became the series' working title -- a suitable rebuttal to those negative headlines he grew up with.

""Prince. Accra. Ghana"" Credit: Kyle Weeks

At first, Weeks was struck by the displays of overt masculinity in Accra: muscles and motorbikes. ""There's a very rigid idea of what masculinity should or shouldn't look like,"" he says. But spending more time in the city, he's met many creatives who are subverting preconceived notions of manhood.

""I bump into a person and he exudes this beautiful energy,"" Weeks says of his subjects, who have included rappers and performance artists. ""When photographing a character like that in a space like that, it's almost like the space transforms.""

""Shakes (Born out of Boredom). Cape Town. South Africa"" Credit: Kyle Weeks

Finding an easy rapport with other millennial males, they've come to be the focus of much of his work across the continent. ""It's a lot easier for me to approach men as a stranger than it is for me to approach women,"" he reasons. ""So naturally throughout all my personal work, there's always a focus on the representation of African men.""

""My fashion editorials play into similar themes,"" he continues. ""I'm predominantly photographing menswear stories and making sure that I use a diverse cast to counter the whitewashing that's so prolific in today's fashion industry.""

However, he has made some exceptions. Last year, Weeks and London-based, Sierra Leone-born fashion editor Ibrahim Kamara went to Accra to shoot a story for M Le Magazine du Monde titled ""Femmes Alpha"" -- a departure for Weeks with its depiction of powerful women. In this story, one woman stops traffic in head to toe snakeskin; another stares down the camera, dripping in gold chains, with two men at her feet.

""Petite Noir. Kinshasa. DRC."" Credit: Kyle Weeks

""It seems to be such a male-dominated society, but then once the door is closed and you're in the home, it's actually so often the mother who runs the household and calls the shots,"" he says.

Power and portraiture

When in Accra, Weeks walks the streets looking for characters that stand out to him. Doing this as a white man with a camera around his neck, he's often met with skepticism.

""I'm quite clearly an outsider there and I can't expect every person that I ask to agree (to have their portrait taken),"" he says. ""As soon as I point out that it's because I think they have great style, or because I'm interested in what they're doing, then they're pretty keen to participate.""

""Brotherhood. Cape Town. South Africa"" Credit: Kyle Weeks

Although Weeks, who is currently based in Amsterdam, often comes from a different background to his subjects, there's a common ground that they share that he hopes is visible to a wider audience. ""I want to use the medium of photography to shed light on the rising youth culture within Africa, and it's through engagement with my peers that I'm able to tell that story,"" he says.

As the warmth radiating from his images attest, it's imperative for Weeks to give his subjects control over how they are presented. During his studies at Stellenbosch Academy of Design and Photography in South Africa, he learned about the history of documentary photography on the continent; a practice largely dominated by white men who'd take full control of the image they were producing, enforcing harmful stereotypes in the process. ""I reached a point where I became so overly concerned with the ethics of who gets to tell whose story and in what way, that for quite a long time I stopped making pictures because I was so hyperaware of my position,"" he says.

So, for his first series ""Ovahimba Youth Self Portraits"" (2014), featuring young Himba herdsmen from northern Namibia, Weeks handed the shutter release over to his subjects. Usually portrayed as regal and ""other,"" in these images they pose confidently in their best sportswear. Once the series was completed, Weeks returned to give them all prints of their portraits.

""I think you're able to install agency within the people that you photograph by not overpowering them with your idea of what you're trying to achieve,"" he says. ""It's about trying to make pictures with a sense of openness and awareness of people's histories.""

""Rich, Jay and Collins. Cape Town. South Africa"" Credit: Kyle Weeks

Moving forward, Weeks hopes to develop his intimate portraiture on the continent, and to publish ""Good News"" as a book.

""My intention is to make beautiful, positive pictures of people from within Africa and to just let that guide me along wherever I travel to make the work that I do."""
http://cnn.com,How architect Mariam Kamara is masterminding a sustainable future for Niger,"Written by Neo Maditla, CNN

Neo Maditla is the former editor-in-chief and content strategist for yearly festival and ideas platform Design Indaba

For Niger-born architect Mariam Kamara, the 2018 Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative presented her with a tremendous opportunity. The two-year program, which pairs emerging creative talents with masters in their field, saw her working under the guidance of British-Ghanaian architect David Adjaye, and allowed her to realize her dream of designing an arts center in Niger's capital city, Niamey. But it also exposed her to her most formidable and outspoken critics yet: a group of high school students.

Though the West African country has one of the youngest populations in the world, literacy rates are low, so Kamara, who founded sustainable design practice Atelier Masomi in 2014, felt it was necessary to create a center that responded to their needs.

""What I had the privilege to do is to really allow (the students) to guide what this project becomes,"" she said over the phone. ""So before Rolex even saw a glimpse of it, I went through the much scarier task of showing it to them. I was nervous because I wanted to make sure that the things we talked about found their way into the design.""

The students told her they wanted a place to read and participate in the arts that reflect their identities as Nigeriens, while also looking to their future. To meet that request, Kamara unveiled her plans for an arts center that also houses an auditorium, a gallery and the city's first public library last year. Once completed (construction begins this summer), the Niamey Cultural Center will be a place for learning, creativity and community-building.

Like her previous projects in the city, the cultural center will be built using compressed earth bricks -- a breathable material responsive to Niger's desert climate and a reflection of local vernacular architecture. The design encompasses four 155-foot curved towers that not only help to cool the interior of the main building by creating facilitating natural ventilation, but also create shaded public courtyards and passages that are accessible to all.

""I know there are people who may not feel that they can enter this large structure because it's very intimidating. So I asked what it means to create space for everyone,"" she said. ""My answer is that it can't be just one big building... I am interested in a structure where you can have a promenade that allows you to be in the space without having to go in.""

The center's location along a valley -- between the French colonial part of the city where the wealthy reside and the side where the less well-off live -- is also significant. Kamara hopes the center will encourage disparate societal groups to come together.

Kamara left Niger to attend university in the United States in 1997. Originally qualifying as a computer scientist, in her 30s she decide to follow her passion for architecture and retrain at the University of Washington.

Though Kamara now splits her time between Niger and Providence, Rhode Island, it's her projects in her home country, blending contemporary and traditional influences, that have earned her the most acclaim and accolades, including the prestigious Prince Claus Award last year.

Her design for a market in the remote village of Dandaji, which includes colorful recycled metal canopies surrounding a sacred tree, has become a vital space for vendors in the region to do trade. And Hikma, the religious and secular complex she designed for the same village in 2018, saw Kamara transforming a derelict Hausa mosque into a library with the help of the adobe masons who originally built it, and created a new, larger mosque alongside it from materials sourced within a three-mile radius. The project was made in collaboration with Iranian architect Yasaman Esmaili, with whom she co-founded the global collective united4design in 2013. The two also co-designed the Niamey 2000 low-cost residential project in 2016.

Kamara said the limitations of working in a country with so few resources has forced her to hone her approach. ""There is something very useful about that scarcity. It clarifies your thinking. It really makes it about space rather than bells and whistles.""

""You cannot hide a bad space when you don't have access to shiny things,"" she continued. ""It becomes more about what the space is doing and how it is bringing people together. That for me is what architecture is about.""

She feels this is especially important at a time when construction has become a significant contributor to pollution in large cities. ""It's impossible to ignore all the climate-related issues,"" she said. ""We need to figure out what progress looks like when it's not fed by exploitation, and recognize our mistakes in terms of construction, material and resource-depletion. Now Asia, South America and Africa can be trailblazers. For me that means there is an opportunity to make a real contribution."""
http://cnn.com,Kenya's best food is a kaleidoscope of flavors,"(CNN) — ""Food tastes much better when you eat it with your hands,"" declares Nairobi-based food blogger Kaluhi Adagala , using her fingers to tease some freshly baked tilapia off the bone. ""It's like a hands-on, intimate relationship between you and the food.""

Adagala is in the dining room of the Delta Plaza branch of contemporary Kenyan restaurant Nyama Mama -- bold with African wax prints -- with a colorful feast of fish, meat, samosas, cornmeal and greens prepared by executive chef Lesiamon Sempele.

Nairobi is the vibrant, chaotic heart of Kenya . It's a fast-evolving city in sharp contrast to the ageless calm of the country's sweeping savannah, lakelands, mountain highlands and Indian Ocean coastline.

Adagala is here to tell us about the essential dishes visitors to the country should try -- though there's huge diversity here in both communities and in the food.

""I'd say landscape has affected the cuisine of our people,"" explains Adagala. ""The people who are in Turkana or the Masai Mara, they are traditional people and their cuisine is influenced by their livestock. The people at the coast, their cuisine is influenced by the trade they have done with Arabs and Indians.""

l e v a r t

Meat

""People love their meat!,"" laughs Adagala. If it's a gathering or celebration, then nyama choma -- Swahili for roast meat, usually goat or beef -- is sure to be center stage.

""It varies from region to region,"" says Adagala. ""In the west, we might roast goat with eucalyptus wood, but in Nairobi it's just a normal roast and served with kachumbari.""

Kachumbari (or salsa) ""goes well with everything,"" she adds. ""It's very simple to make. I like mine with tomatoes, a splash of lime juice, some onions and chili.""

Ugali, a polenta-like cornmeal slab, is the other essential side dish. It's ""our staple food,"" she says, but it's ""an acquired taste."" Outsiders might complain it's bland, but for Kenyans, it's the ultimate starchy comfort food, and with the right spicy accompaniments, it comes to life.

""Have ugali with some vegetables and a very rich meat dish, like well-cooked tilapia or matumbo, to bring everything together,"" advises Adagala.

Matumbo, or tripe, ""is dark and black and looks like a towel,"" but served up in bao in Nyama Mama's Asian fusion take on a Kenyan classic, it's some of the tastiest stomach you'll eat this year.

""We are not wasteful at all,"" says Adagala. It's not just offal that's on the menu. When the goat is slaughtered for the nyama choma, its blood might find its way into a mutura sausage, a spicy delicacy of offal, garlic, ginger, chili and coriander, all bound together by the red stuff.

Fish and chicken

""Tilapia is the most common fish in our country,"" says Adagala, and, traditionally, it's often fried. The vast Lake Victoria, which Kenya shares with Uganda and Tanzania, is the main producer of freshwater fish.

Uduvi (shrimp) and kamba (prawns) are particularly delicious wa kupaka, which means ""with a rich coconut curry stew."" Kuku kienjeyi -- free-range chicken -- is also a top candidate for the coconut treatment.

Pulses and vegetables

Nyama choma might be popular for gatherings, but when it comes to everyday eating, ""Kenyan cuisine in its essence is actually heavily vegetarian,"" says Adagala.

One of the country's vegetable staples is sukuma wiki, collard greens cooked with onions and spices. Its literal translation is ""end of the week,"" typical of a food culture which traditionally has been more about subsistence than extravagance.

""Mboga is the umbrella term for vegetables,"" explains Adagala. ""We have many traditional vegetables which are common in the western part of the country, whch is where I came from."" Kanzira is African kale, managu is African nightshade and terere is ""similar to wild spinach.""

Adagali recommends trying githeri, a casserole of maize and beans, with a side of avocado, while other popular pulses include ndengu (mung beans) and njahi (black beans).

Every cuisine benefits from a starchy potato fix, so for the Kenyan twist try viazi karai (fried potatoes) or viazi via ryo (potatoes in a tomato and coconut sauce). Mukimo is a vividly hued mash of potatoes and green vegetables while irio is a variant with peas and corn.

And then there's matoke, which is part of the plantain family. Adagala says ""it's a lot starchier, a little bit less sweet"" and ""fantastic for stewing.""

Indian and Arabic influence

Kenya has a large Indian population, a migration which began in the late 19th century when indentured laborers were recruited from British-ruled India to build the Kenya-Uganda railway.

There are plenty of Swahili classics whose names will sound familiar to fans of Indian food -- chapati, samosas, bhajia, biryani and pilau -- although they're given a local spin.

Kenyan chapati, for example, are made with white or all-purpose flour, and are fried in vegetable oil or ghee before serving.

""For festivities, we like having pilau, and also masala fries (French fries with spicy sauce), because they're just considered a bit more festive,"" says Adagala.

Cuisine on Kenya's eastern coast is influenced by the fresh ideas -- and ingredients -- brought in by trading with India and Arabic countries.

""The coastal people are more expressive when it comes to spices, they're very bold and very assertive,"" explains Adagala. ""When you come inland, people like their food more simple. They like tasting the essence of the ingredients. They even consider use of spices as an interruption.

""When you go to the west, we also like our food more simple. The only difference is we put more traditional salts. We like smoking our meats; we like roasting our meats with specific types of woods.""

Sweet things and drinks

Mendazi -- samosa-shaped but donut-tasting -- are a delicious breakfast treat. Vibibi, rice and coconut pancakes, are another light, fluffy delicacy to start the day.

And of course, you need something to wash them down with.

""We export the best coffee in the world but what Kenyans really love is tea,"" says Adagala. Chai masala, lightly fragrant, lightly sweet, milky tea, is a breakfast classic.

Tea might often be enjoyed at breakfast with nduma, a starchy tuber which is prepared simply by boiling with a pinch of salt.

Alternatively, Adagala prepares it with a crispy coating:

Falooda, an Indian-style milkshake, is another of the imports to have made it here from Asia.

When it comes to street snacks, sugar cane is often seen for sale. Kenyans old and young like to slice it up and suck upon it like a straw.

""For the older folk there's an alcoholic juice called busaa; it's made using fermented soghurm flour,"" says Adagala. ""You put fermented soghurm flour or just the seeds in a big pot, pour in some water and some yeast, then let it ferment."" When it's ready, men like to ""gather around the pot and they all drink from it.""

Where to eat in Nairobi

Nyama Mama is ""one of the best Kenyan restaurants"" in Nairobi, says Adagala. ""It's very popular because it takes Kenyan classics and gives them a nice twist.""

She also recommends Swahili Plate, in the Central Business District, for tasty, no-nonsense local cuisine, and for nyama choma she recommends Roadhouse Grill and Carnivore. ""Carnivore does everything from beef to crocodile to duck. Everything!,"" she says.

And for Kenyan-style gourmet burgers, her top tip is Mama Rocks, at hip hangout and ""creative hub"" The Alchemist.

""But as unprecedented economic uncertainty has set in around the world and in the Toronto real estate market, it has become too difficult to make the 12-acre project financially viable without sacrificing core parts of the plan,"" Daniel Doctoroff, chairman and CEO of Sidewalk Labs, said in a blog post . ""After a great deal of deliberation, we concluded that it no longer made sense to proceed.""

Alphabet started working on the project in 2017, committing more than $50 million to reducing traffic congestion, carbon emissions and landfill waste using technology. But the plan quickly sparked controversy because of concerns over the amount of citizen data it would collect, and was widely slammed by privacy campaigners and politicians.

As part of a 1,524-page report laying out its vision, Sidewalk Labs proposed intersections with sensors, tracking the movement of all people and vehicles. The company said this would help move traffic swiftly and ensure walk signals leave added time for slow walkers, such as the elderly.

http://cnn.com,US cities are losing 36 million trees a year. Here's why it matters and how you can stop it,"(CNN) If you're looking for a reason to care about tree loss, this summer's record-breaking heat waves might be it. Trees can lower summer daytime temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a recent study .

But tree cover in US cities is shrinking. A study published last year by the US Forest Service found that we lost 36 million trees annually from urban and rural communities over a five-year period. That's a 1% drop from 2009 to 2014.

If we continue on this path, ""cities will become warmer, more polluted and generally more unhealthy for inhabitants,"" said David Nowak, a senior US Forest Service scientist and co-author of the study.

Nowak says there are many reasons our tree canopy is declining, including hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, insects and disease. But the one reason for tree loss that humans can control is sensible development.

""We see the tree cover being swapped out for impervious cover, which means when we look at the photographs, what was there is now replaced with a parking lot or a building,"" Nowak said.

More than 80% of the US population lives in urban areas, and most Americans live in forested regions along the East and West coasts, Nowak says.

""Every time we put a road down, we put a building and we cut a tree or add a tree, it not only affects that site, it affects the region.""

The study placed a value on tree loss based on trees' role in air pollution removal and energy conservation.

The lost value amounted to $96 million a year.

Nowak lists 10 benefits trees provide to society:

Heat reduction: Trees Trees provide shade for homes, office buildings , parks and roadways, cooling surface temperatures. They also take in and evaporate water, cooling the air around them. ""Just walk in the shade of a tree on a hot day. You can't get that from grass,"" Nowak said. To get the full temperature benefit, tree canopy cover should exceed 40% of the area to be cooled, according to a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . ""A single city block would need to be nearly half-covered by a leafy green network of branches and leaves,"" the authors wrote.

Air pollution reduction: Trees absorb carbon and remove pollutants from the atmosphere.

Energy emissions reduction: Trees reduce energy costs by $4 billion a year, according to Nowak's study. ""The shading of those trees on buildings reduce your air conditioning costs. Take those trees away; now your buildings are heating up, you're running your air conditioning more, and you're burning more fuel from the power plants, so the pollution and emissions go up.""

Water quality improvement: Trees act as water filters, taking in dirty surface water and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil.

Flooding reduction: Trees reduce flooding by absorbing water and reducing runoff into streams.

Noise reduction: Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown psychological benefits.

Protection from UV radiation: Trees absorb 96% of ultraviolet radiation, Nowak says.

Improved aesthetics: Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and value of any property.

Wildlife habitat: Birds rely on trees for shelter, food and nesting. Worldwide, forests provide for a huge diversity of animal life.

Planning for trees

Nowak says there's a downside to trees too, such as pollen allergies or large falling branches in storms, ""and people don't like raking leaves."" But, he says, there are ways cities and counties can manage trees to help communities thrive. ""You can't just say 'we're not going to have forests.' We might as well manage and work with the trees.""

""You don't want a tree in the middle of a baseball field. It's very difficult to play sports if you have trees in the way. Or trees in the middle of freeways.""

Nowak says we can design and manage tree canopies in our cities to help ""affect the air, to affect the water, to affect our well-being.""

Urban forests especially need our help to replace fallen trees. Unlike rural areas, it is very difficult for trees to repopulate themselves in a city environment with so much pavement and asphalt.

""A lot of our native trees can't actually find a place to drop an acorn so they can regenerate,"" explains Greg Levine, co-executive director for Trees Atlanta.

""That's why the community has to go in and actually plant a tree because the areas just aren't natural anymore.""

The job is not complete when the saplings take root. Organizations like Trees Atlanta and their volunteers plan most of their year to care for these young trees until they're mature enough to thrive on their own.

""We try to prune trees for 10 years to make sure they get a good healthy structure."" Levine adds. ""We also add mulch around trees to help keep the moisture in the ground so the tree doesn't dry up. We have to have a lot of patience with planting trees around pavement, making sure that they can rise to the challenge. ""

How you can help stop tree loss

Protect what you have: Nowak says the first step is caring for the trees on your own property. ""We think we pay for our house, and so we must maintain it. But because we don't pay for nature, we don't need to. And that's not necessarily true.""

Prune the dead limbs out of your trees: If they're small enough, do it yourself or hire a company. The risk of limbs damaging your house is significantly lowered when there's tree upkeep, Nowak said.

Notice where your trees may be in trouble: Often, you can observe when something's wrong, such as when branches are losing leaves and breaking or when mushrooms are growing at the base or on the trees. You can also hire an arborist or tree canopy expert to assess the health of your trees on an annual basis. Or you can contact your local agricultural extension office for advice.

Don't remove old trees if it's not necessary: Instead, try taking smaller actions like removing branches. ""It takes a long time for these big trees to get big: 50 to 100 years. And once they're established, they can live a long time. But taking a big tree out and saying 'we'll replant,' there's no guarantee small trees will make it, and it will take a very long time to grow.""

Allow trees to grow on your property: Although everyone's aesthetic is different, it's the cheap way to get cooler yards and lower energy bills. It's also an inexpensive approach to flood and noise control.

Nowak says he laughs when his neighbors wonder why their property doesn't have more trees, because ""I hear people running their lawn mowers."" Fallen seeds need a chance to implant, and constant mowing prevents that. If you don't like where a seedling is growing, you can dig it up and plant it or a new tree where you like.

Educate yourself about trees and get involved: Many cities have tree ordinances that seek to protect very old, significant trees. You can get involved by attending city council meetings. You can also help your city plant trees by joining local nonprofit groups.

http://cnn.com,What will staying in a hotel look like in the near future?,"(CNN) — Goodbye, breakfast buffets and bellhop service. Hello, temperature screening and keyless check-in.

While pandemic-era policies are still being developed at hotels around the globe and will no doubt vary widely, it's safe to say that guests will see big changes the next time they check in anywhere.

For the foreseeable future -- until a vaccine, widely effective treatment or instantaneous testing for coronavirus is available -- hotel stays are likely to be a stripped-down affair, particularly in higher-end hotels where personalized service and amenities have long been part of the draw, says Christopher Anderson, professor of business at Cornell University's Hotel School in Ithaca, New York.

There will be less communal access in hotels, ""so no buffets, no minibars,"" and many of the ""high-touch elements of luxury"" such as spa treatments and bellhop and valet service may be suspended, Anderson predicts.

Guests will want keyless and contactless check-in and checkout and few personalized interactions.

""We're going to want to strip those away and basically walk into the hotel, go up the elevator by myself, enter my room without having to touch anything with some comfort that the service provider has completely disinfected that space prior to my arrival,"" he says.

In the United States, there are faint glimmers of a return in demand for hotel rooms, according to Jan Freitag, senior vice president of Lodging Insights for hospitality analysis firm STR.

Hotel occupancy for the week ending May 2 was at 28.6% in the US, giving STR its first ""solid evidence"" of a return of leisure demand, led by states that had eased restrictions.

Occupancy was still down 58% compared to the same week last year.

As demand creeps up, the hotel industry is trying to reassure potential guests that they've put additional measures in place to protect against coronavirus transmission as states and countries start to reopen.

Socially distant and cleaner than ever

Hygiene, of course, is a top concern, and the American Hotel & Lodging Association on Monday released industrywide Stay Safe standards (pdf) . Many major hotel groups have also outlined new policies.

Hotel behemoth Hilton is developing policies with help from the Mayo Clinic's Infection Prevention and Control team. Hilton is exploring the use of electrostatic sprayers -- which uniformly mist disinfectant across wide areas -- and ultraviolet light to sanitize surfaces and objects.

Marriott has already announced that it will use electrostatic sprayers to clean guest rooms and public areas and is testing ultraviolet light technology. Marriott and other brands will also be removing furniture and reconfiguring many areas to facilitate the six-foot social distancing space prescribed by health officials. The brand is considering plexiglass barriers at front desks to separate guests and hotel staff.

These new measures will certainly affect hotel owners' out-of-pocket costs, Freitag says, but whether guests will see those costs in room rates is unclear.

""Maybe cleaning fees are the new resort fees,"" Freitag says. In either case, staying in a hotel in 2020 will ""absolutely"" be cheaper than it was last year.

Guests in more than 3,200 Marriott hotels can use their phones to check in, access their rooms and order specially packaged room service delivered to their door without contact.

Masks and gloves for staff will be ubiquitous at many hotels, and hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes will be the latest additions to public spaces and personal care amenity kits.

The Venetian in Las Vegas is among many properties underlining the six-foot rule of social distancing with markings to indicate proper spacing at front desks, in elevator lobbies, coffee shops, entertainment venues and more.

Venetian reception employees will use every other workstation to properly distance and slot machines, restaurant tables, pool loungers and more have been spaced to comply with the rule.

The resort suggests no more than four guests in an elevator. The Hamilton Hotel in Washington, DC, urges guests to limit that number to two.

Properties are also outlining policies specific to suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19 on site. Those measures often include intensive third-party disinfection measures of rooms occupied by guests who become ill.

Will guests be screened?

Temperature screening for guests and employees is one line of defense in detecting possible infection, but it's unclear how widely it will be implemented in hotels.

At The Venetian in Vegas, which has not yet reopened, thermal scanners will be used at every entry point ""allowing discreet and noninvasive temperature checks"" for staff and guests, according to the resort's new Venetian Clean policies

In Singapore, a national campaign called SG Clean has been rolled out across industries and includes a set of standards for hotels (pdf) , which includes temperature checks for guests, ""where feasible and applicable.""

The Four Seasons in New York has been following an incredibly austere set of temporary protocols since it started hosting health care workers in early April.

Those policies, developed by travel risk management company International SOS, include a single point of entry for everyone where each person's temperature is checked and questions are asked by nurses staffing the entry 24 hours a day, according to the plan's architect, Dr. Robert Quigley, International SOS's senior vice president and regional medical director for the Americas.

Related content World's longest flight suspended by coronavirus

But asymptomatic transmission means that strict social distancing is also required, and Quigley predicts that best practices in screening at hotels could evolve with the availability of rapid diagnostic testing.

The Four Seasons playbook was International SOS's first set of coronavirus hygiene standards for a hotel and has been adapted for other hotels hosting medical workers, but Quigley said in the past couple of weeks, properties have started contacting the company about practices that could be used for traditional leisure and business travelers.

But the level of screening implemented at Four Seasons New York during this period is probably not feasible for every property, Quigley acknowledges.

""It's not going to be realistic for hotels across the spectrum to have these extreme measures of mitigation that I'm talking about,"" he said. ""And so then they have to say, these hotels that don't have those capabilities or resources, 'What is our risk appetite? What is our duty of care to our employees and to our guests?' ""

Figuring out what's needed to keep guests safe

Rudy Tauscher, general manager at Four Seasons New York, has been at the forefront of that hotel's hosting of health care workers. He has been mulling how the traditional guest experience will change.

""Is there a different time, for instance, between check-in and checkout? Very often hotels have a turnaround where you check out in the morning and in the evening, the room is occupied again. Would there be an extended period of time of let's say, 24 hours?"" Tauscher wondered, noting that he was shooting from the hip about possible modifications.

Cost structures and operational models would have to be considered, he said.

Related content The plane that's become a pandemic hero

Since the Four Seasons New York started hosting medical workers in the coronavirus epicenter, a cleaning protocol designed by International SOS has involved leaving rooms empty for long periods between a series of cleanings to make sure that any contamination is eliminated.

But that protocol was tailored to a very specific situation. The Four Seasons luxury brand is working on exactly what new measures guests will find at its hotels around the globe and at the property on New York's 57th Street when it reopens to guests who aren't health care workers.

Social distancing measures, reduced capacity public spaces and redesigned restaurants, bars and fitness facilities will be among the changes.

""Once business levels resume, we recognize that the expectations and needs of hotel guests will have changed, and Four Seasons is well-positioned to emerge from this crisis with a new perspective on what luxury means for this new world: embracing technology, enhancing tools and training and strengthening our already stringent health, safety and cleanliness protocols,"" said Christian Clerc, Four Seasons' president of global operations, in a statement.

The future of high-touch spaces and services

Many of a hotel's public spaces and amenities will need an overhaul for the coronavirus era.

For example, room service might be preserved as there's more control in who touches what, says Anderson, from Cornell's Hotel School, but buffets are likely a no-go.

And he's not sure that services such as buffets -- whether hotel breakfast bars or full-blown Vegas-style spreads -- will ever come back.

""I think just our awareness of transmission now is going to be heightened and so ... even though it might be safe and there might not be a pandemic scare, psychologically it might not be attractive anymore,"" he said.

Prewrapped, grab-and-go offerings are likely to be the solution in the near future, Anderson said.

High-touch public areas such as spas and gyms -- where it's also difficult to social distance -- pose a ""really, really high risk for transmission,"" Quigley said, with lots of handles and doorknobs that would need very attentive cleaning.

But not all hotels have given up on those services.

Bangkok-based Anantara Hotels, Resorts & Spas said in outlining its new policies that ""fiitness and holistic classes will be adapted for guests' optimum wellbeing,"" referencing private personal-training sessions.

And Mandarin Oriental also hopes to offer many of its personalized services. They are still working out details, but the luxury brand's spa director doesn't want to further deprive guests who were craving human contact even before the pandemic took hold.

""If social touch becomes even more rare post-coronavirus, spas may provide a unique haven where people can experience touch in a clean and safe environment,"" said Jeremy McCarthy, the hotel group's director of spa and wellness.

It will require inspiring customer trust, he said.

http://cnn.com,India has a looming air con headache. Does antiquity hold the solution?,"Written by Amani Al-Aidroos Tom Page, CNN

As the climate crisis makes the world hotter, people are looking to stay cool. By 2050, there could be three times as many air conditioning units on the planet as there were in 2018. But are an estimated 5.6 billion units -- and their accompanying energy demands -- really the answer?

In India, for example, the International Energy Agency believes air conditioning could account for 45% of peak electricity demand by 2050 unless things change. The vast majority of India's electricity supply still comes from coal (although heavy investment in renewables is underway). Pair dirty energy with hydrofluorocarbons , the highly-potent greenhouses gases used in air conditioning units, and you have a solution that's compounding the problem in the long term.

Luckily there's people like New Delhi architect and designer Monish Siripurapu. The founder of Ant Studio is looking at the issue of cooling and is looking back -- way back -- for answers.

India is no stranger to passive cooling systems: the famous stepwells of Rajasthan have used water evaporation to offer relief from the heat for over 1,500 years. Jaali, a type of latticed screen filtering sunlight indoors, are another centuries-old method of keeping cool. But for his solution Siripurapu turned to the Ancient Egyptians, who would fan a porous jar of water to produce cool air.

Dubbed the CoolAnt, Siripurapu's system comprises a honeycomb-like network of terracotta tubes. Water is circulated by an electric pump over the surface of the structure, inspired by a beehive for maximum surface area, he explains. Water evaporates from the terracotta surface when air passes through the tubes, cooling the air.

The studio's cooling system was first conceived for factories and places where machines throw out hot air. With temperatures in summer upward of 50 degrees Celsius near the air exhausts, the CoolAnt system can reduce the heat to the mid-30s Celsius, its creator claims.

Ant Studio's first model in a factory in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, is topped up with 200 liters of water every week, recycled by the factory, and used 3-4 hours a day, six days a week, explains Siripurapu.

""We are trying to re-adapt this in multiple places for different needs,"" says Siripurapu. ""We have implemented (it) in a café, in a school, and we have done one in a residence.""

Ant Studio's work is also providing custom for local potters, who Siripurapu says are losing out to advanced manufacturing techniques. Typically, one cooling system requires around 700 tubes. Siripurapu says the studio is looking to scale up, and is fundraising and consulting with organizations like the United Nations Environmental Programme.

There is growing interest in a return to vernacular architecture , using localized methods and materials, and bioclimatic architecture , designing to take account of the local climate without needing to use additional energy to cool or heat buildings.

In South East Asia, T3 Architecture Asia has designed affordable apartments in Ho Chi Minh City, and hotels in Cambodia and Myanmar, that feature ventilated roofs, fiber-glass insulation and open-air corridors negating the need for air con. At Expo 2020 Dubai next year, national pavilions will use numerous zero-energy cooling methods, including one inspired by ""barjeel"" wind towers, a concept that dates back 5,000 years.

""Civilization,"" Siripurapu says, ""cannot continue to build the same way that we are doing.""

""Unfortunately, as an architect, we are used to looking at a single client ... we don't really look at the bigger picture,"" he adds. ""The motivation now, what we are trying to do, is (see) how our spaces, our interventions, can actually impact millions of people.""

""We can still be very sustainable and make something really good."""

No really, it can happen. Take Zuraina Zaharin from Malaysia. She's built a business off the back of a loo break. Not just any loo break, of course. This one was near Everest in the early 2000s when she was climbing in the region -- and it was pretty bleak.

""I was facing this problem: the toilet,"" she explains. ""It's easy for men to do their business; they can just do it anywhere. But not for the ladies. We have to wait until we find some nice spot. Even then, I can't do it. I just have to find the toilet.""

Those in charge of crafting the NFL schedule face a tall task.

It's a vast challenge to craft an appetizing prime-time slate while balancing bye weeks, travel schedules, non-NFL venue reservations, potential international play and games at least three days a week for 17 weeks.

The 2020 season schedule is an even bigger challenge than usual given the potential contingencies in place because of the coronavirus pandemic.

And yet, must-see matchups litter the official schedule. Super Bowl contenders, top players and eye-catching storylines elevate a handful of games sure to command the spotlight and go down as some of the season's best.

Here are the matchups we can't wait to see in 2020."
http://cnn.com,2020 MLB Amateur Draft Reportedly Shortened to 5 Rounds amid COVID-19,"Julio Cortez/Associated Press

The 2020 Major League Baseball draft reportedly will be shortened to five rounds because of the COVID-19 pandemic, per ESPN's Jeff Passan and Kiley McDaniel.

""All players who go undrafted would be eligible to sign for a maximum of $20,000. While there was a proposal to the union for a 10-round draft, the sides didn't come to an agreement,"" Passan wrote.

Passan also highlighted the discord among front offices about the draft length.

""There remains a significant divide within the team side on the draft,"" Passan wrote. ""A majority of front offices were pushing for a longer draft, recognizing the value reaped even in later rounds can be immense. Pushback to keep the draft as short as possible from some owners was strong.""

The draft is typically 40 rounds, and last year's selection process contained 1,217 players.

Reducing the number of rounds from 40 to five is a cost-cutting maneuver in light of the season's delay. Per J.J. Cooper of Baseball America, over $61 million was spent on players acquired after the fifth round last year.

But the move will clearly hurt players who would have otherwise been drafted after Round 5. Cooper had more:

""That agreement came at a significant cost to MLB draftees, who in many cases will find the door to playing pro baseball closed in 2020 unless they are willing to accept signing bonuses that are well below market value. The deal also potentially pushes back the date of the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 international signing periods by six months apiece. MLB has the flexibility to move back the start dates of those signing periods for each of those years to as late as Jan. 15.""

Cooper also wrote that teams will be limited to spending no more than $20,000 on undrafted players' signing bonuses. The maximum was $125,000 last season.

A return to play wouldn't recoup all of the potential money that could have been earned in 2020, either, as it's expected that the typical 162-game season will be shortened to around 80 to 100 if it happens, per David Lennon of Newsday.

Furthermore, games will likely be played without fans, so teams could lose out on gate and concession revenue entirely.

Citing Forbes, Christopher Smith of MassLive.com estimated that the Boston Red Sox could lose $199 million alone, with all 30 MLB teams in the red by $2.86 billion.

Ultimately, MLB and the MLB Players Association's decision to truncate the draft makes sense given the game's financial state due to COVID-19, but amateur players looking to start their careers will take the biggest hit as their inroads into the Show are stifled indefinitely."
http://cnn.com,A Facebook group matches RVs that are sitting idle with health care workers who need a place to isolate after long hospital shifts,"(CNN) For Mark Quale, an emergency room physician in Burlington, North Carolina, coming home after a long day at the hospital was as stressful as work itself. With two young boys, a wife and elderly mother-in-law at home, he knew that if he wasn't cautious, he could spread the novel coronavirus to his own family.

So just as he arrived home from work, he would strip off his scrubs on the front porch, walk the specific route to his bathroom that was cordoned off by a tarp and wash all the germs off in the shower.

But today, Quale's mind is more at peace because he's able to isolate himself in a 31-foot travel trailer, and it's all thanks to a Facebook group called RVs 4 MDs , which matches health care workers to local RV owners.

It started with a Facebook post

From an ICU nurse in Twin Cities, Minnesota, to an ER doctor in Lynchburg, Virginia, RVs 4 MDs has matched dozens of health care workers with RVs, trailers and campers in their area. The Facebook group has already racked up nearly 3,000 members, an incredible number given the fact that the group was created just one week ago.

Emily Phillips, her husband, Dr. Jason Phillips and their son, Beau. Emily started RVs for MDs to help connect health care workers with RVs so they could stay self-isolate while staying near their homes.

Last Monday, Emily Phillips, a mother of three from Celina, Texas, had posted on her Facebook asking if anybody had an RV her family could borrow as her husband was an ER doctor in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. A woman named Holly Haggard replied saying that Phillips could borrow hers.

""Before the RV, I was a nervous wreck. Every time my husband walked in the door or put his hand on something, I thought we were going to get (Covid-19), including my baby,"" Phillips said. ""But now that he's in that RV, I'm back to my life, focused on my full-time job and my kids, and it's completely changed our situation.""

Knowing that there were countless other families in similar situations as hers, Phillips took on Haggard as her business partner and the two created RVs 4 MDs, which went live last Tuesday night.

In a matter of one week, the two Texan moms have built the simple Facebook group into a robust volunteer organization, complete with a board of directors and network of volunteers spanning across the nation.

Kindness from complete strangers

Quale and his family were one of the first to be matched with an RV from a pair of kind strangers named Kelsey and Tim Webb. The two families had never met before, but Tim drove his trailer for 2.5 hours to Quale's home, gave Quale's wife, LaRayne, the keys and told her that they could use it for as long as they needed.

Tim Webb drove 2.5 hours to temporarily donate his travel trailer to LaRayne Quale (right).

""It was such an emotional thing to go through and to have someone offer up their RV completely for free, I felt so blessed,"" LaRayne, who now volunteers with RVs 4 MDs said. ""I asked if they wanted us to cover the insurance, but they wanted nothing... They said that they are praying for us and rooting for us.""

Kelsey, who normally makes money by renting out the trailer, said donating it to the Quales was a ""no-brainer.""

""This family was in need and this was the one way we could help,"" Kelsey told CNN. ""You can't put a price tag on this... It just makes my heart happy that we're able to do this for them and give them peace of mind.""

Quale said he was extremely proud of his fellow health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic, but he added that this virus isn't something that can be defeated by the medical professionals alone.

""(RVs 4 MDs) demonstrates that there is so much more to fighting the coronavirus than what happens at the hospital. There are layers upon layers of people fighting this in different ways. The reason I'm able to fight this right now is because of my wife and the work that these people are doing so we can focus on the medical portion and not have to worry about the rest,"" Quale said.

More volunteers are needed

Every hour, there are new posts on the Facebook page from spouses and family members looking to be matched with an RV.

""Looking for an RV in Grapevine Texas. Wife is camping out on the apt patio,"" one post reads.

""ER Doc in Rochester NY has been living in the garage for 3 weeks to protect our 3 kids and me,"" another post reads.

But with each new request, there's an equal amount of posts from RV owners saying that they want to help.

""I have never seen anything like this in my entire life,"" Phillips said. ""The amount of people that are stepping up to help with a project where they aren't even getting a dime in return is unbelievable.""

Dr. Jason Phillips (left) and Dr. Craig Reese Brockman with a donated camper that Brockman will use to prevent the risk of passing along the coronavirus to his family.

To keep up with this project that has spread like wildfire, Phillips has recruited the help of attorneys, people in insurance and IT, but what she needs the most right now are more volunteers, she said.

""We need more volunteers to head up the different states,"" Phillips said. ""A lot of people are out there with nothing to do. Well, we got something to do and it can really help a lot.""

Phillips and her team hope to expand the program into Canada, set up an official website, and even keep it going after the coronavirus crisis is over.

""We're going to keep it running until there's not one person left on the planet that needs an RV or needs shelter,"" Phillips said. ""Whether it's a storm or whatever the case is, we'll have this organization for the next crisis because there's always going to be a need for shelter."""
http://cnn.com,Canada is giving their essential workers a pay raise they 'deserve',"(CNN) Canada is hiking wages for essential workers across the country, in a blunt admission that many who are now risking their health to work during the pandemic are in some cases making the least.

""If you are risking your health to keep this country moving and you're making minimum wage, you deserve a raise,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced this week, making good on a promise to increase salaries.

Trudeau's government hammered out an agreement with provinces and territories to spend more than $3 billion and raise wages for essential workers making less than about $1,800 a month.

""I think one of the things that we're seeing through this pandemic is that there are people who are tremendously economically vulnerable, and vulnerable in other ways in our society, who are extremely important to the functioning of our society,"" Trudeau said.

Rehman Asad/Barcroft Media/Getty Images Muslims maintain social distancing as they offer prayers at the Baitul Mukarram National Mosque in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on Thursday, May 7.

The Muslim holy month of Ramadan has begun, and the holiday looks much different than it has in years past.

Because of the coronavirus pandemic, many Islamic holy sites remain empty, including Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia and the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Worshippers are being advised to pray at home.

Other mosques are trying to practice social distancing."

(CNN) More devastating unemployment data expected today will pour fuel on President Donald Trump's argument that the US economy cannot stay closed much longer.

But in his haste to convince states to return to normal life, the President appears to be turning a blind eye to warnings that reopening too quickly -- and without the right precautions in place -- could leave more Americans dead.

Yesterday, the White House rejected a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report on how to reopen the country, as US jobless claims hit 33.3 million and the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak passed 75,000.

The document, which included step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to open doors and life to resume, was criticized as ""too prescriptive,"" sources told CNN.

Americans are concerned that lifting lockdowns right now will lead to a ""second wave"" of the virus. More than two-thirds of the nation — 68% — are worried about their respective states being reopened prematurely, according to a new poll from Pew Research Center

That fear has been echoed by former US Vice President Al Gore , who slammed the Trump administration's handling of the crisis, saying this about what could come next: ""I think we are seeing the start of a botched reopening.""

YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED

Q: Are things getting better or worse in the US?

A: A total of 44 US states are expected to partially reopen by Sunday — nearly the entire country. But the coronavirus crisis isn't getting better everywhere. There are signs of improvement in 16 states — but the situation is deteriorating in many more. Things are getting better in states like Montana, New York, and Colorado, where some schools are starting to reopen as new daily cases plateau or drop. But things are getting worse in places like Minnesota and Puerto Rico, where cases were up 50% between last week and the week before. Only a few states -- like California and Florida -- are holding steady. Take a look at our US Covid-19 tracking map.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY

Trump to be tested daily

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, as well as members of the White House staff, will be tested daily for the coronavirus after a military official identified as the President's personal valet was infected . A White House spokesperson said Trump and Pence had both tested negative for the virus since their exposure.

Meanwhile, the rollout of millions of antibody tests in the US has created frustration and division among state health departments due to a mix of questionable tests, shifting federal rules and a hodgepodge of different methods for tracking results. Despite public health experts advising that accurate testing and coordinated tracking of that data will help get Americans back to work, the Trump administration has left plans up to the states — now they're split on what to do.

Crisis mounts in Latin America

More than a month after Flavio Ramos' death, his family still hasn't buried him. They couldn't if they tried, because soon after his death, his son says hospital authorities lost the body. His disappearance illustrates how the healthcare system in Ecuador's second-largest city , roughly the size of Chicago, collapsed within a matter of weeks after the outbreak exploded in March.

And, in the same week that President Jair Bolsonaro declared that ""the worst had passed,"" Brazil has seen a surge in deaths — cases have spiked to more than 135,000, making it a global hotspot. Bolsonaro's own spokesman has tested positive too. Now, the nation's health ministry is admitting that stricter lockdowns may be necessary for the hardest-hit regions.

Australia's 3-step plan to reopen economy

Australia's Prime Minister has outlined a three-part plan for relaxing restrictions, which the country will take to achieve a ""Covid-safe economy in July of this year."" But the final decision about easing lockdowns remains in the hands of state governments.

Virus could kill up to 190,000 in Africa

The coronavirus could kill as many as 190,000 people in Africa over the next 12 months, but is expected to ""smolder"" for years, the World Health Organization has warned. A study predicts that between 29 and 44 million people could become infected in the first year of the pandemic, if containment measures fail.

A recent survey of health services found an average of nine intensive care unit beds per 1 million people in 47 African countries, which the WHO called ""woefully inadequate.""

""Plandemic"" conspiracy video scrubbed

Social media companies, including Facebook and YouTube, say they will remove a viral video that made false medical claims about the coronavirus. ""Suggesting that wearing a mask can make you sick could lead to imminent harm, so we're removing the video,"" a Facebook spokesperson said

TOP TIPS

""Think about yourself as a SWAT team member. Get in, get out, leave as little trace of yourself as possible."" These aren't tips for a covert mission, but a trip to the grocery store. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta has this advice for shopping safely during the pandemic: The key is to plan ahead — write a list! Next, make your visit as short as reasonably possible. You need to be efficient in the store and think about every surface you might touch. You do not want to dilly-dally.

http://cnn.com,May 7 coronavirus news,"Former US Vice President Al Gore said that President Donald Trump and his administration have failed to properly handle the Covid-19 pandemic.

""He has failed as president. Particularly on this challenge. The warnings were ignored,"" Gore said during CNN's global town hall.

Gore said when he was vice president, he began every day with a report from the intelligence community and:

""There were very few occasions where there was a stark warning about grave danger to the country, and whenever there was such an occasion, we stopped and said hold the show. Get the FBI, get the CIA, get whoever was involved over, we need to learn about this,"" Gore explained.

Gore said he believes Trump both missed the warnings and ""failed to mobilize the resources of the federal government to straighten out this testing catastrophe, to get swabs, and the so-called re-agents they need to do the tests, and the gowns, and masks, and all of the other stuff.""

Reopening too soon: Gore also said he's concerned the country is not ready to reopen.

""I think we are seeing the start of a botched reopening,"" he said.

Trump, Gore said, ""may be recklessly rolling the dice hoping that he can goose the economy just enough in the third quarter of this year to enhance his reelection prospects, hoping that he can divert the blame for the extra tens of thousands of Americans who the doctors tell us will die as a result of this, and blame it on the Chinese or former President Obama or whoever, instead of doing what a president needs to do.""

http://cnn.com,What a country's pandemic response reveals,"This analysis was excerpted from the May 7 edition of CNN's Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe.

(CNN) It's too early to compare how different countries are handling Covid-19, said Boris Johnson earlier this week -- the UK Prime Minister whose country just overtook Italy as the place with the most known deaths in Europe.

This is a rare crisis that all nations, regardless of geography and political systems, are facing simultaneously. Comparisons aren't exact, given quirks of epidemiology, population density and different standards for tallying infections. But lessons from standout leaders could help those at the bottom of the class.

Elsewhere, the emergency revealed governments' weaknesses. The ""one country, two systems"" principle bore fruit for Hong Kong, which contained the virus but put to shame the mainland, where the Communist Party's paranoia slowed its response. In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban exploited the crisis to seize near-dictatorial powers. And Russia's Vladimir Putin may be a grandmaster in geopolitical chess, but his domestic crisis management was again exposed as shaky.

Here in the US, the virus magnified President Donald Trump's liabilities -- knee-jerk denial, spreading misinformation, spouting snake-oil treatments and blaming foreigners. There is good and bad in the US federal system, which does well in elevating local leaders but brews clashes between the states and Washington.

(CNN) The prospect of a prolonged economic slump is coming into sharp focus, as global forecasts project an economic collapse at a scale not seen since the Great Depression.

The staggering extent of the economic pain the United States faces was crystallized in a new round of unemployment data released today: 1 in 5 American workers has filed jobless claims since lockdown measures took effect in mid-March.Every day brings signs that what first looked like temporary job cuts could turn into permanent layoffs. Families are already feeling the effects. Among mothers with young children, almost one-fifth say they're going hungry, according to a survey by the Brookings Institution — a rate far worse than in 2008, during the global financial crisis.

President Donald Trump has made clear that the economic cost of the national lockdown has grown too steep, despite projections that many more will die as the US reopens. ""We have to be warriors,"" Trump said yesterday. ""We can't keep our country closed down for years."" And while he reversed a decision to phase out the coronavirus task force, it will now be pivoted to focus on reopening the nation.

The bleak financial picture looks much the same across the pond. As Europe begins to open back up, Brussels warns the eurozone faces an existential threat if the economies of member states do not recover evenly. The UK is headed for the worst crash in more than 300 years , according to the Bank of England, which said the country's economy could contract by 14% this year.

The calculations are a bleak reminder that the fallout from the crisis could cripple the world's economy for months, and likely years, to come.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY

US stockpile no match for pandemic

As complaints about dire shortages of protective gear for medical workers on the frontlines of the Covid-19 crisis began to stream in, President Donald Trump was quick to point the finger of blame at his predecessor, Barack Obama. To an extent, the President was right. The Obama administration used and then failed to replace items from the nation's Strategic National Stockpile to fight the 2009 H1N1 ""swine flu"" pandemic. But Trump hadn't replaced those items either, despite repeated warnings that the country was ill-prepared for a pandemic, stockpile experts said.

The British government is facing similar criticisms that vital items of personal protective equipment (PPE) were missing from the UK's national stockpile. To shore up supplies, the government ordered around 400,000 surgical gowns from a Turkish company in mid-April. But the gowns were never distributed among health workers because they did not meet safety standards.

First ICE detainee dies from coronavirus

57-year-old man from El Salvador became the first person to die from coronavirus while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, a senior US immigration official told CNN.

Reports of the man's death drew swift condemnation from immigrant rights organizations, who've been pushing for weeks for ICE to release more detainees from its facilities and warning that the Trump administration is using the pandemic to push its aggressive immigration agenda. The US has continued to deport thousands of people during the outbreak — including some who are sick

Sports return to US

On Saturday, the UFC is scheduled to become the first sport in the US to return to action, with the organization's president acutely aware of the increased scrutiny that's inevitably coming his way. All eyes are on Dana White and his Ultimate Fighting Championship, with three fight nights planned in the space of eight days in May. And the stakes simply could not be higher. ""Listen, we have families, too,"" White told CNN Sport. ""I don't want to die.""

Germany's success story

Behind Germany's success in bringing the virus to heel is Angela Merkel. The German Chancellor, who has a PhD in quantum chemistry, has made a remarkable turnaround since the start of the year — when she was relegated to the sidelines as a lame duck leader. Now she is a beacon of global leadership, Ivana Kottasová writes

Yesterday, the Chancellor unveiled plans for the partial lifting of Germany's lockdown, allowing shops to reopen and people to meet in small groups. ""The first phase of the pandemic is behind us but we are still at the beginning and it will be with us for a long time,"" Merkel said.

57,000 people are still stuck on cruise ships

Most cruise passengers have made their way back home, and the vast ships that once ferried them from port to port are moored up or back on the water, relocating for the next stage in their journeys. But what about the crews that kept these gigantic vessels going, and looked after guests as panic over the coronavirus swept across the oceans?

Brazil sees record daily deaths

Brazil, the hardest hit country in Latin America, registered a record number of cases and deaths yesterday, forcing the health minister to raise the possibility of strict lockdowns in hotspots.

The spokesman for President Jair Bolsonaro has become the latest government official to test positive for the disease.

Photographer Ruth Medjber has been taking pictures of her Dublin neighbors since March, when people began isolating themselves because of the novel coronavirus. These portraits provide a window into lockdown life

Ruth Medjber Maeve, Paul and their 9-month-old baby, Beth, are photographed in their home in Dublin, Ireland. Photographer Ruth Medjber has been taking pictures of her Dublin neighbors since March, when people began isolating themselves because of the novel coronavirus.

Every night, just after sunset, Ruth Medjber chats with her neighbors in Dublin, Ireland, and snaps a portrait of them at their windows.

The photos offer a tiny glimpse of people's lives during this global pandemic.

""I started out shooting just friends and family as a way of connecting with them during lockdown,"" the photographer explained. ""I live on my own, so I was desperately missing even the simplest of interactions. Knowing that I was going to see friends each evening gave me a sense of purpose.""

Now she's making new friends.

The photo project has taken off online, and she has opened it up to volunteers. The only requirement is that they live within 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) of her home — the restriction set by the Irish government.

""I pick a street each night and try and shoot as many volunteers as possible,"" Medjber said. ""I usually average about four shots before the light fades completely, but two if I'm chatting a lot — which I tend to do.""

She said the response to her project, Grá Sa Bhaile (Love at Home), has been overwhelming.

""I think people like knowing that they're not alone in their isolation, and they really try to pick out people who are similar to themselves in the series,"" she said. ""It's also a different view of the pandemic: the more human view. Instead of showing what the virus has taken from us, it shows that it has given us more opportunities to bond with family and friends and spend time together."""
http://cnn.com,Europe and China were on course for a reset. Coronavirus changed all that,"(CNN) Before coronavirus brought the world to its knees , 2020 was slated to be a crucial year for the European Union and China.

At a showpiece summit in September, the two are set to take a significant step forward in their economic and strategic relationship. At least that was the plan.

China's response to covid-19 has left a bitter taste in the mouths of European officials. From draconian clampdowns on its own citizens to accusations of spreading misinformation in Europe, this crisis has been a reminder that closer engagement with China comes with risk.

As things stand, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to gather EU leaders and China's President Xi Jinping in the German city of Leipzig on September 14.

German diplomats say the location was selected because of the former East Germany's historical relationship with China. They say that Merkel, chairing the EU Council presidency for the final time in her chancellorship, was personally invested in the summit's success.

Indeed, pulling China closer to European values on human rights, climate change and multilateralism is the sort of thing leaders' legacies are made of. And while the Leipzig summit is far from a make or break moment in Europe's relationship with China, this level of fanfare has a lot to live up to.

However, there is a real sense in Brussels that the pandemic has led to a reset in European thinking on China.

""I think the coronavirus has been a necessary reminder to a lot of EU states that however attractive Chinese money looks, it is also a systemic rival,"" says Steven Blockmans, head of EU foreign policy at the Centre for European Policy Studies.

I think the coronavirus has been a necessary reminder to a lot of EU states that however attractive Chinese money looks, it is also a systemic rival. Steven Blockmans

Blockmans is referring to a communique released by the EU Commission in March 2019, in which it described China as ""a systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance"".

In the context of coronavirus, that Chinese model of government is concerning EU officials.

Last month, the European External Action Service published a report on disinformation surrounding covid-19 , saying that ""Official and state-backed sources from various governments, including Russia and -- to a lesser extent -- China, have continued to widely target conspiracy narratives and disinformation.""

Days earlier, Politico Europe published an excerpt from what it said was a draft version, which explicitly accused China of running ""a global disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the outbreak of the pandemic and improve its international image.""

A spokesperson from the EU's Foreign Affairs and Security Policy told CNN the document cited by Politico was not in fact a draft report.

Whatever the truth, it's clear that some in Brussels are very concerned about China's behavior.

""It's all about seeing which (political) system is better at handling the virus. Is it a system that allows personal liberties? Or is it single-party autocracy where you can impose measures without worrying too much,"" said one EU official working across external affairs.

A picture shows a screen of a video conference call between members of the European Council, seen at the Elysee Palace in Paris, on March 26, 2020, to discuss coordination of EU efforts to tackle the outbreak of covid-19.

This lack of trust seems to be taking hold across Brussels. Over the weekend, the EU's Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, said in an interview with France's Le Journal du Dimanche that Europe had been ""naïve"" in its dealings with China. He went on to acknowledge that China has a ""different understanding of the international order.""

So, where does this all leave what was supposed to be the year where China and Europe finally got on the same page?

At the time of writing, very few believe that the Leipzig summit will be as Merkel and co first imagined.

On a practical level, the virus has meant that the two sides have not been able to physically meet. European diplomats point out that in the EU Council building, there are normally around 30 meeting rooms for representatives from the 27 member states to meet in and discuss sensitive issues. ""Now there are only about 10 that can guarantee social distancing,"" said one diplomat.

Velina Tchakarova, head of institute at the Austrian Institute for European and Security Policy, predicts that ""China's actions during and after the covid-19 would result in further disagreements and fragmentation within the European countries [on] how to settle the relations with Beijing.""

She points to disagreements on issues like allowing Chinese firms to build 5G networks and EU-level decisions on who can and cannot invest in member states.

For these reasons and more, most believe that the Leipzig summit will be totally overshadowed by coronavirus.

However, despite these low levels of trust and overt acknowledgment that China is a ""systemic rival,"" it seems likely the EU will try and get things back on track.

""It will make us rethink, but at the same time we cannot walk away from China,"" an EU diplomat told CNN. ""All of our economies rely on supply chains that run back to Wuhan and beyond. We've always said no one's interests are going to be served from not trading with them. So that problem will always be there.""

Another German diplomat defended pressing on, saying that ""China's influence is rising, but it's not one-sided. Obviously, China also needs Europe."" This, Brussels officials hope, means it can pressure China on things like its position on human rights.

For the EU, engagement with China is about more than money. ""Increasing its engagement with China gives the EU a chance to double down on its strategic priorities,"" says Blockmans, referring to the key EU foreign policy priority of balancing its relations with China and the US, giving the EU more autonomy on the world stage.

However, concerns over China's transparency during the pandemic has been a sharp reminder as to exactly what engagement with China actually means.

On one hand, the EU's calculation on China hasn't changed: it's still desirable to not get squashed between the two great superpowers, China and America. On the other, recent history shows China to be an unreliable partner who divides opinion among EU member states.

Sooner or later, Europe will have to weigh these two realities up and decide exactly how much that diplomatic independence from America is really worth."
http://cnn.com,British politicians are concerned a 'virtual parliament' cannot hold Boris Johnson's government to account over coronavirus,"London (CNN) The UK Parliament is expected on Thursday to approve plans that would see lawmakers hold the government to account via a video link, as the country's legislative chamber returns from its Easter recess on Monday.

Proposals for the so-called ""virtual parliament"" will allow Members of Parliament to question government ministers on their handling of the coronavirus pandemic, while also observing social distancing measures.

However, the proposals only allow for limited parliamentary work to take place and are causing alarm among some that MPs will not be adequately capable of holding the government to account. Boris Johnson's Conservative government is facing serious criticism over its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The move also comes as trust between the main opposition Labour Party and the Conservatives is particularly low, following four years of bitter divisions over Brexit.

The proposals will allow MPs to grill ministers on the government's coronavirus response as the UK enters what most experts agree will be its peak of the crisis, but Parliament will still be far from operating as usual. While it will still be possible for votes (known in the UK as ""divisions"") to take place in the House of Commons -- the means by which legislation receives Parliamentary approval -- these will still be restricted to members sat in the chamber itself.

In a letter to MPs, Hoyle said ""I am aware of interest among colleagues in the possibility of using technology to allow Members to participate in divisions without being present on the Estate,"" adding that he had asked parliamentary staff ""to undertake preparatory work as a matter of urgency on a system of remote voting in divisions of the House.""

The issue of only a handful of MPs being able to vote on government business is concerning some in opposition.

""It's vital parliament can do its business of questioning the government and holding it to account -- especially now,"" says Chris Bryant, an influential member of parliament for the Labour Party. ""The government should commit to only bringing forward business that has complete agreement from both sides of the House until there is a temporary means of voting remotely.""

This view is shared by a Labour Party source, who told CNN that they ""strongly support a fully virtual parliament including the ability to have divisions for the duration of this crisis. This should be delivered as quickly as technologically possible.""

Votes are not the only problem that a physical absence poses to Parliament. Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee, says ""the major issue with not being in Parliament is that a lot of our work is done by bumping into each other and working out small problems informally.""

The move to a virtual parliament in Westminster comes at a time of wider uncertainty about Parliament's future. The building is in desperate need of repair and modernizing. There are currently plans in place to vacate the estate in order to carry out this work, which would include: replacing heating, water and drainage systems and installing technology. One stark example of how badly the work is needed: part of the refurbishment will include replacing the sewage ejector system, which the Parliamentary website says was ""installed in 1888 and is still in use today.""

Other legislative chambers around the world -- including the devolved administration in Scotland -- have introduced measures allowing lawmakers to carry out their usual work with as little disruption as possible. This varies from agreeing to smaller gatherings of lawmakers in Ireland and Germany to physically distancing despatch boxes in Australia so that politicians can observe social distancing.

However, Westminster is both larger than many of these bodies and more divided. Unlike many European nations, British politicians are not historically good at working across party lines at the highest level, meaning agreements will be harder to reach.

Parliament will return on Monday, where the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, will lay down the government's business for the day. Precisely what happens after that -- and in the coming weeks -- is still up in the air."
http://cnn.com,Greece says it'll reopen to tourists on July 1 as it claims success over Covid-19,"(CNN) — Greece's tourism appeal is no secret, but with most of us still in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis, the idea of spending our summer there can only be a distant dream.

Or maybe not, say Greek officials.

The Mediterranean nation appears to be a rare coronavirus success story.

By enforcing a strict and early lockdown, the country has managed to keep deaths incredibly low -- just around 150 so far.

This week, some businesses like hairdressers and bookstores were allowed to re-open for the first time.

And the country's pragmatic prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, thinks it may, ever so cautiously, be a model for welcoming back some travelers this summer.

""The tourism experience this summer may be slightly different from what you've had in previous years,"" Mitsotakis told CNN's Nic Robertson when they sat down -- socially distanced -- in his office this week.

""Maybe no bars may be open, or no tight crowds, but you can still get a fantastic experience in Greece -- provided that the global epidemic is on a downward path.""

New travel protocols

l e v a r t

Opening up to tourism inevitably means opening the country up to people potentially carrying the virus, but Mitsotakis hopes current testing regimes can be enhanced to reduce the risk.

At the moment, every international traveler is screened for Covid-19 upon arriving in Athens.

Before CNN's reporting team even landed in Athens this week, we were asked to complete a form on our flight from Zurich with all our personal information, as well as our seat number -- presumably to allow authorities to trace close contacts should someone onboard test positive.

Upon landing in Athens, we were immediately herded into a room where everyone's throat was swabbed and catalogued.

We got our results back less then 12 hours later (negative, thankfully).

Mitsotakis is hoping for something much more comprehensive. He wants international, or at least European, standards that set the same travel protocols for all countries.

""I would assume that people will be tested before they get on a plane, not after they arrive here.

""They can only get on the plane with a negative test, or with a positive antibody test,"" he said.

If all goes to plan, he hopes the country can start welcoming tourists by July 1.

Targeting high-end tourists

Given the amount of effort it will take to get here at a time when airlines -- including the low cost carriers that transport most of the country's foreign air arrivals -- have stopped flying most services, Mitsotakis is banking on ""more high-end tourists.""

""Yachting, for example, where you have a fewer number of people who are on a boat, and then they go out to eat or buy provisions,"" he says.

""Agrotourism, tourism in smaller hotels seems to me to be better suited for this new sort of post-pandemic world.""

The question of when and how to open is no trivial point for a nation that's been roiled by recession and economic turmoil for more than a decade.

This country's GDP is at least 20% dependent on tourism, double the global average.

With over 31 million tourists in 2019, three times its population, Greece has more than doubled its number of visitors in 10 years and billions have been invested in services and infrastructure. At least one in four Greeks works in tourism or related industries.

Early forecasts had been projecting a booming year, leading Irene Petrakou and her two brothers to invest in the hotel they run in central Athens.

Opened by their parents in the 1970s, the family business has been their main source of income.

""Early bookings looked good, we decided to renovate,"" says Petrakou. ""The current situation creates big cashflow issues for us.""

City hotels are expected to re-open as of June 1, with seasonal hotels expected to follow up to a month later.

Yet, as Petrakou points out, there is still no clarity on when international flights will resume -- a major concern given 90% of Greece's tourism revenue comes from international visitors

""The first part of the summer is already lost,"" she adds.""Clients with bookings later in the season have a 'wait and see' approach, which is good.""

Like many in the industry, Petrakou believes that Greece's success in containing the virus early is key to the country's tourism brand surviving this crisis intact and could lead to a quicker recovery.

The Greek prime minister told CNN that the sense of collective success around the country's fight against Covid-19 will be a legacy he takes away from the crisis.

""And I dare to use the word pride,"" he adds. ""Greeks haven't been proud in a long, long time,""

That pride, and what he hopes will be the relative safety of Greece's Covid-19 strategy thus far, will be a draw this summer."
http://cnn.com,Copenhagen's new Metro is a thing of beauty,"Copenhagen (CNN) — In Copenhagen, traffic is usually caused by the two-wheel variety of transportation: the bicycle.

Ever since bicycles were imported into Denmark from France in 1869, they have become the main form of transportation in the Scandinavian city. In the 1920s, it wasn't unusual to see both the working class as well as high society pedaling through the streets. But with the opening of the Metro's new M3 Cityring line, commuters have a new way of getting around.

While Copenhagen's Metro has always been rather efficient, many neighborhoods lacked stations, and thus, accessibility.

In addition, a growing population of about 10,000 new residents per year is taxing the buses and trains already in circulation. In a city of 650,000 people, about 200,000 commute on the Metro daily, sometimes in conjunction with a bike during their journey.

Greater accessibility

Cityring, a 15.5-kilometer (approximately 9.63 miles) circular line with 17 new stops — which nearly doubles the number of existing stations — now connects outlying neighborhoods that radiate far from the city center. Residents won't need to rely on their bikes to get around, a boon especially during Copenhagen's hygge-inducing winters.

The impetus for the project was twofold, according to Henrik Ploughmann Olsen, CEO of Copenhagen Metro. ""First of all, it was a question of improving public transport, making it more efficient and of better quality,"" he said. ""But it was also about city development in other areas outside of the city center.""

Public squares were constructed, with 150 benches and 800 trees, were installed around the 17 new stations. The plazas not only allow access to the Metro, but will hopefully encourage more commerce and housing.

""We see that it attracts shops but also offices and service-oriented businesses,"" said Olsen.

Building the line was not without its challenges.

Olsen acknowledged that the eight years of construction impeded traffic and generally disrupted people's daily lives. ""We had the machinery right outside people's windows for quite a substantial number of years,"" he said.

Technical issues also challenged tunnel designers. They had to build around older structures with shaky foundations, such as the historic Frederik's Church, a.k.a. Marble Church, at the Marmorkirken station.

Controlling groundwater was also imperative during construction.

""A lot of the houses in the inner part of the old city center are actually founded on wooden piles from the 17th century or 18th century,"" explained Olsen, ""If you remove the groundwater from those piles, they'll rot.""

In addition, builders had to deftly maneuver around existing Metro tunnels--but Olsen proudly notes the extension was completed without causing any shutdowns to the current system.

Shiny, new rails

The new M3 line allows Copenhagen to compete on an international level. Reginaldo Sales/Metro Company

The line itself is a thing of beauty; sleek and gleaming like a seal shimmying through water, this shiny new rail line is runs automatically without any conductors.

The system operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year -- a rare service offered by only a small handful of cities worldwide, including New York City, Chicago, and Melbourne -- and a full rotation around the line takes 24 minutes. Average speed is about 40 kilometers per hour (approximately 25 miles per hour) but when a train hits top speed, it can cruise at 90 kilometer an hour (55 miles per hour).

Unlike older stations, all the new stops are outfitted with two elevators instead of one and the incline of stairs was reduced to make going up and down flights less taxing. For today's iTouch culture, screens by ticket machines supply riders with route information and maps.

Not just easy on the ride, Cityring's stations are easy on the eyes.

Glass and light are key design elements and stations were designed to integrate with their surroundings. At the Frederiksberg Allé station, for example, the green interior color scheme is a segue to the outdoor park that greets riders when they reach street level.

Cleanliness and efficiency are two tenets of the Metro system. Revenue generated from ticket sales is reinvested into maintenance, and quarterly surveys of passengers give Metro operators direction on what's working, what's not and where they need to direct funds.

Bike-friendly

The Cityring doesn't want to compete with bikes, but instead integrate itself into existing transportation infrastructure. ""Metro actually supports the thoughts of the having bikes being either last mile or first mile mode of transportation, so you could use it in combination,"" said Olsen.

Bikes are allowed on the Metro during non-rush hours, and cellars at every station provide storage for the two-wheeled vehicles when not in use. Screens at exit points announce nearby bus and train departures for easy connections.

While these features have residents excited about the new system, Olsen believes ""the most important thing is that you don't have to look up time table,"" he said. ""You can just go through the station and there'll be a train right after."" To him, freedom from the shackles of a schedule exemplifies the ease of using the Metro.

The new M3 line — and the expansion of the Metro in general — not only services the city internally, but allows Copenhagen to compete on an international level. Citing Hamburg, Germany, and Stockholm, Sweden as nearby rivals, Olsen hopes to attract both businesses and tourists to Copenhagen via opportunities presented by the Metro.

With the opening of the M3 Cityring, ridership is expected to rise from 65 million to 122 million by 2020, and two extensions to the existing M4 line are due to open over the next five year.

While projections are ambitious, Olsen's definition of success is more modest."
http://cnn.com,How Budapest became a fine dining force to be reckoned with,"(CNN) — While Budapest may be primarily known for its architecture, geothermal springs and communist heritage, the city's gastronomy scene has been gaining considerable travel attention in recent years.

New and exciting fine dining spots are constantly opening up in the Hungarian capital, many headed up by prolific chefs keen to inject imagination and prestige into the Budapest dining experience.

Two restaurants in the Hungarian capital were awarded new Michelin stars in the past 12 months alone, bringing the total of Michelin-awarded establishments in Budapest to six.

Hungary only received its first Michelin star nine years ago, so this is a pretty remarkable turnaround.

There's little doubt a culinary revolution is underway in the ""Pearl of the Danube,"" but what's brought about this burgeoning movement?

Record numbers of tourists and a booming economy have definitely played a part.

With Hungary's difficult past well documented, it's fair to say that fine dining hasn't necessarily been a high priority for locals haunted by Communist austerity.

""Hungary was always a pretty poor country,"" explains Hungarian food critic Andras Jokuti. ""So the main goal of Hungarian cuisine was to stay alive. It was very important to have lots of proteins and carbs -- it was based around potato and meat.""

Culinary movement

Miguel Vieira at Budapest restaurant Costes tells CNN Travel what makes great, creative cuisine.

Shifting this perception has been a lengthy process, which continues today. However, the tide is definitely turning.

Portuguese chef Miguel Rocha Vieira believes this is partly due to good quality produce becoming more readily available in the country during the past decade.

""We'd have to buy butter from abroad [before] because there was no good quality butter here,"" he tells CNN.

""Everything is completely different now.""

Vieira heads up Costes, based in Raday Street, and was at the restaurant's helm when it became the first in the country to earn a Michelin star back in 2010.

He produces modern takes on classic Hungarian dishes, serving up four to seven-course set menus with various wine pairings.

Jokuti feels that Vieira injected life into the dining scene by merging both Hungarian and Portuguese influences into his dishes early on.

""When Miguel arrived in Budapest, it was like the very beginning of the fine dining story in Hungary,"" he says.

Vieira admits he knew little about Hungarian cuisine when he came to the country all those years ago and was often ""hammered by critics.""

""My cooking has changed a lot,"" he adds. ""Now I can tell you proudly that my stamp is in the food.""

""One of the biggest compliments we can have here is if somebody says, 'I felt this dinner had personality.""

While Vieira tries to incorporate Hungarian traditions in his dishes, this isn't the ""ultimate goal"" and he certainly doesn't have Michelin stars in mind while in the kitchen.

""I always say to the boys, 'We should cook for ourselves. We should do what we believe.' It's not about cooking for awards,"" he adds. ""It's not looking for stars or for recognition.

""That's the cherry on top of the cake. But that's not why we work 14, 15 or 16 hours a day.""

Modern interpretations

Chef Tamas Szell from Budapest restaurant Stand on his modern interpretations of traditional Hungarian dishes.

Hungarian chef Tamas Szell has been credited with putting Hungarian food on the map back in 2016, when his modern interpretations of the country's traditional dishes won him the gold medal at the prestigious 'Bocuse D'or Europe' competition.

Szell and co-chef Szabina Szulló head up the kitchen at Stand, which was awarded its first Michelin star this March, has a similar approach to cooking to Vieira.

""Food is the best communication between a chef and the guests,"" Szell tells CNN.

""Hopefully our dishes contain the sweet memories from childhood. When I cook a dish, it should be acceptable to both our grandmothers and a Michelin inspector. This is the most difficult [part] I think.""

Stand opened in Budapest in 2018 following the success of market hall bistro Stand25, which Szell and Szulló also ran together.

""My inspirations definitely come from my childhood,"" he adds. ""My mother had a saying, 'we are poor but we are living well'.""

Szell says his fisherman's soup, which contains carp, paprika, water and tiny ravioli type pasta known as deraya in Hungary, is the second most popular soup after goulash.

""When I was a child, my mother often made it this way,"" he explains.

Szell's dishes appear to be having the desired impact. Stand, based on Székely Mihály street, has been a big hit since it launched.

In fact, Jokuti describes it as the ""the perfect Hungarian restaurant,"" praising the inventive way Szell manages to tone down the richness of traditional Hungarian cuisine.

""This, I think, is his biggest achievement. To somehow recreate the traditions into something modern,"" says Jokuti.

Szell sources his dairy products from a tiny farm just outside Budapest, which supplies to a handful of fine dining restaurants in the city.

Within 48 hours of the milk leaving the cow's udder, it's being served up back at Stand in the form of cottage cheese,

""I think the ingredients are the most important thing,"" adds Szell. ""The good ingredients always try to find the chef and the chef always tries to find the best ingredients.""

Find out why Budapest restaurant Babel is a unique feature of the city's culinary scene.

Situated in Budapest's downtown, Babel is one of the most recent restaurants in the city to be awarded a Michelin star.

It's relatively small, with around a dozen tables, exposed brick walls and dim lighting, offering an intimate dining experience.

Inspired by Hungarian traditions and the Romanian region of Transylvania, chef Istvan Veres presents five to 10 course tasting menus containing simple ingredients such as nettle or lichen.

Veres says cooking is an ""obsession"" rather than a passion for him, describing how he'll often dream about a dish and then attempt to bring it to life the very next day.

""In fine dining, you have to do something special, something unique,"" he says.""You put your soul on the plate.""

""I'm never scared about new things.""

According to Jokuti, it's this fearlessness that makes Veres such a trailblazing chef.

""Istvan's taste is not that easy to follow,"" says Jokuti. ""I love to go to Babel because I'm always surprised.""

Basic ingredients

Salt is tipped to become the next Budapest restaurant to receive a Michelin star. Courtesy Salt Budapest

Hoping to repeat the success of Stand, Babel and Costes, is new dining establishment Salt, which has only been open since October.

It's run by chef Szilard Toth and manager Mate Boldizsar, who often serve up the dishes to diners themselves.

Toth regularly goes foraging for produce in the Hungarian countryside, coming back with all types of edible delights.

""We find so many basic ingredients that an average chef does not really see very often,"" Toth tells CNN.

""This means we can introduce a world of flavors for our food -- amazing flavor pairings that can't be found anywhere else.""

The chef's table is positioned in the middle of the restaurant, so diners can wander over to ask questions about the dishes, or just watch Toth and his team in action.

Dishes are presented simply -- some don't even require cutlery -- and customers can opt for a Hungarian wine pairing menu to complement their meal.

The team at Salt pride themselves on transforming basic produce into fine dining and the restaurant is filled with jars containing fermented or pickled items found in the forest.

""We have a course called greasy bread,"" says Boldizsar. "" In its original form, it's a very, very simple dish.

""Just a piece of bread with some fat. We put some bacon on it, some caviar and some lambskin.""

Only time will tell whether Salt will gain a coveted Michelin star, but the restaurant does seem to be winning over may diners in the short time it's been around for.

""I think he [Toth] shows that it's possible to create a very hedonistic, but still very modern meal from sometimes humble, but very Hungarian ingredients,"" says Jokuti.

A restaurant like Salt would have seemed inconceivable in the Hungarian capital a few years ago.

Its emergence is a clear indication of the adventurous direction the city's culinary scene is currently moving in.

""It's really fascinating to witness these times in Hungarian cuisine,"" says Jokuti.

""I'm traveling a lot, visiting the world's best restaurants. It's amazing to see that I can come home and eat at these fine restaurants.

""It's not like, 'Okay, it's not so good, but it's at least it's Hungarian.'"

http://cnn.com,'I Know This Much is True' casts Mark Ruffalo as troubled twins with a dark family history,"(CNN) Mark Ruffalo bites into the juiciest of actor buffets in ""I Know This Much is True,"" portraying twin brothers, one of whom is a paranoid schizophrenic. Once you get past the soapy title, this six-episode limited series offers a grim but gripping adaptation of Wally Lamb's book, rife with tormented family history and the struggle to overcome the past.

We meet the more troubled brother, Thomas, in grisly fashion, engaging in an act that will force Dominick, a house painter, to take a more active role in overseeing his care. ""Thank you for being a good brother to me,"" Thomas says pitifully.

For Dominick, the burden of dealing with Thomas has been left to him by their late mother (played by Melissa Leo), and he feels the weight of the obligation. In that respect, the theme bears a considerable resemblance to ""Promise,"" one of the great Hallmark Hall of Fame movies, with James Garner charged with handling his increasingly disturbed brother, played by James Woods.

Lamb's 1998 novel -- an Oprah's book club selection -- and this adaptation by writer/director Derek Cianfrance (""The Place Beyond the Pines"") contain several additional layers. For starters, there's the whole twin aspect, and questions about what made one brother turn out this way and the other not. In that, Dominick is guided by a psychiatrist (""The Good Wife's"" Archie Panjabi) despite his resistance, initially telling her, ""There's no use delving into the secrets of the past.""

The story also reaches beyond this generation's DNA to the family's dark history, with Dominick learning more about that than he ever wanted to. Finally, there's the devastating tragedy he experienced in his own life, one that upended his relationship with his wife (Kathryn Hahn) and has undermined future romances going forward.

http://cnn.com,Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time. But at what cost?,"(CNN) Dozens of actors and film crew members crammed into a small hair salon in an upscale Cairo neighborhood in early April. They were racing to finish filming a TV serial scheduled to premiere during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which starts next week.

The narrow streets of the Egyptian capital were a beehive of activity with ​dozens of crew members moving up and down the road or resting on plastic chairs on the sidewalks. ​

In previous years, the crowd, the six trucks and 32 vehicles lining the surrounding streets would have attracted passers-by hoping to see their favorite film stars. It is a common sight in the weeks before Ramadan, a high season for TV, when crews work 16-20 hour days to meet their deadlines.

But at a time when Egypt is observing a partial curfew to stem the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic , concerned neighbors were alarmed to see a big crowd ignoring social distancing guidelines and called the police. That day officers showed up to the set seven times but everything they were doing was perfectly legal, Ahmed Yehia, a producer working on the serial, told CNN.

Yehia works on a comedy, but his experience is representative of the Egyptian pre-Ramadan film industry.

Egypt's government advises against activities involving crowds and only imposes fines on those violating the ​curfew, which was 7pm-6am initially. President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, who promised cash handouts to ​workers impacted by the virus, said in a televised speech last week that he did not want to completely ""suspend ​work completely in all sectors.""

Since the start of the outbreak, the government has suspended schools and universities, grounded most flights and closed mosques and churches in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. It advised those who can to work from home, but encouraged production in different industries to continue, including TV which is mostly controlled by privately owned companies with ties to the state.

Insiders in the multi-million dollar TV industry warned that continuing to work in crowded sets over long hours could be deadly. ​

""How can we make a living if we and our loved ones are dead?"" script writer Mariam Naoum said in a public appeal ​on Facebook to stop productions on March 22. By that date, the virus had ​officially claimed 14 lives, including two military generals, and the country's confirmed cases stood at 327. TV channels were pressuring producers, who were pressuring actors to continue filming, Naoum said.

Though she was able to work from home as a scriptwriter, she felt she was facilitating the work that was happening on those crowded sets, she added: ""I feel that with every scene I [write and] send, I hurt people that I love very much.""

'Ramadan is our Super Bowl'

Millions in Egypt and around the Arab world will be glued to the high-production period dramas and thrillers throughout the holy month of Ramadan, which begins on April 23.

Discussions of plot twists dominate the traditional family gatherings after the day-long fast. In good years, Egypt can produce up to 80 serials for that month alone, shown on local and ​international Arab channels selling ad slots to corporations splurging on big stars and expensive productions. ""Ramadan is our Super Bowl,"" film director Tamer Mahdy said about the ad industry.

This struggle between protecting people from the virus without bringing the economy to a screeching halt is mirrored globally, in everything from government responses to people's daily choices.

Billboards for a Ramadan TV series in Cairo in 2018.

Egypt has a population of ​nearly 100 million people living in densely populated cities and villages. Its fragile health care sector is reeling under budget cuts and its political leadership ​is widely perceived to lack transparency, and flout its own rules. ​

A third of the population lives in poverty and at least half of the economy is made up of workers who depend on daily wages for survival

""There is no protective gear. And that's why doctors are at high risk,"" Dr. Mohammed Hassan, ​a physician and former Egypt's doctors' union leader told CNN. ​But for a population the size of Egypt's, experts worry about the country's capacity, with just 346 ventilators set aside to treat coronavirus patients.

Health and government officials didn't respond to multiple CNN requests for comment over the span of a week. ​

Egypt's Minister of Health, Hala Zayed, has repeatedly cited Egypt's low number of confirmed cases as a point of pride for the Egyptian government. Egypt reported 2,505 cases and 183 deaths as of Wednesday and the World Health Organization (WHO) has commended its early interventions to contain the virus.

But experts warn that the health sector is ill-equipped to handle an outbreak like the one seen in Europe​, and equipment shortages are affecting hospitals across the country. ""We managed to collect donations and buy the basic medical supplies,"" a cardiologist at a public hospital told CNN. ""The health ministry is doing its best,"" but ""a corrupt and poor system"" can't be reformed during a pandemic, she added. The cardiologist spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid punitive measures.

At least three doctors ​have died from the novel coronavirus and 43 others health workers ​have tested positive, the doctors' syndicate said, leading to partial closures of public hospitals offering free healthcare to thousands of the most vulnerable​. One of the hospitals that has had to reduce its capacity is the National Cancer Institute. ​The WHO said 13 percent of Egypt's confirmed cases are healthcare workers.

And even where the capacity still exists, some patients say they don't feel safe. Seeing how some doctors and nurses didn't use basic protective gear or observe social distancing at a public hospital, cancer patient Amr Asaad told CNN he is ""reluctant to resume his chemotherapy.""

Stopping is not an option

""Postponing or not shooting is not an option,"" said Mohammed Gamaleddine, a line producer in an upcoming Ramadan drama, told CNN. ""We are freelancers, not rich stars. There are hundreds of people who work in this industry and most of us may stay at home with no job or money from year to year. It could be the only gig we have,"" he added.

Despite these appeals and the concerns expressed by crews and actors, shooting only stopped on productions that were so behind in their schedule that they would not have been able to meet their deadlines while working under the curfew​, according to several industry insiders who spoke to CNN. ​Those who had finished 70% of filming ​acquired permits to work through the curfew, scaled down the production, halved the number of crews on newly sterilized sets and brought physicians on site​, they said.

An empty street in Cairo during the coronavirus pandemic.

Ashraf Zaki, the head of the semi-official actors' syndicate said in early April only 25% of the planned serials would make it to the screens in Ramadan.

""The government wants us to finish the series, so people can find something to entertain them during the lockdown. The production company will pay a huge fine [to TV networks] if they don't deliver before Ramadan,"" Yehia, the producer who worked on the shoot at the hair salon, told CNN.

A week later, Yehia's crew moved to a hotel to film a number of other scenes. A shoot at the hotel reception involved 130 people. The following scene was shot in a hotel room, with a minimum of 20 people ""after cutting down all unnecessary staff,"" he explained. To cut costs, by paying the hotel for one day instead of two, the crew kept on working for 20 hours -- a common practice in the annual race.

""Right now, I am wearing a mask and gloves, but in a couple of hours -- like every day -- I will get too busy or get tired and will throw them away,"" Yehia told CNN on the phone from the hotel. ""We are all crammed in one place. There is no way we can have social distancing.​""

""We all would rather be at home with our families. I am so scared for my family. I agreed with my wife that the kids will be safer in our hometown Alexandria and I haven't seen them or my mother for the past three weeks,"" Yehia added.

http://cnn.com,Making a 'squat' a home,"It's an idea that intrigues German-born photographer Corinna Kern , who moved into a squatted commercial building for several months in order to document the uncommon lifestyle unfolding behind its walls.

She first visited a squat -- a building occupied by people who don't own it or pay rent -- out of personal interest in April 2013, while she was in London studying for her master's degree.

The notion that this interest could be developed into a wider concept only came along a month or two later, she said. The result is a striking collection of photographs and text titled ""A Place Called Home,"" in which she seeks to challenge common preconceptions about squatters -- and explore the idea that home is more a feeling than a physical place.

Having moved into her new home in a squat in Kentish Town, north London, Kern had to figure out how to coexist in one building with 30 people and three dogs. She also found herself part of a wider alternative community that's both transient and close-knit.

Through the connections she made, she visited six other squats in north and south London. One was in a former fabric warehouse, another in an abandoned garden center, a third in a white-walled former design studio.

""As the squatting scene is very interconnected, I came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe,"" she said. ""The unusualness of the different places, which may not comply with the idea of home in the common sense, intrigued me and shaped my project.""

All the squats Kern visited were in former commercial premises. A law enacted in September 2012 made it illegal to squat in residential properties.

I came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe. Corinna Kern

With housing costs high in London and affordable options in short supply, squatting can seem an appealing option to some people -- although, as Kern points out, it's not a lifestyle chosen simply because of homelessness or poverty.

""What might commonly be perceived as a shelter for the homeless or poor is often a conscious choice of an alternative and communal way of living,"" she writes in the text accompanying her images.

""The squatting lifestyle attracts many individuals on their search for adventure, freedom, friendship and self-discovery. Yet, it demands sacrifices and the ability to change and adapt.""

The squatters' campaign group SQUASH (Squatters' Action for Secure Homes) says no one knows how many squatters there are nationwide at any one time. But it is clear that tens of thousands of people in the UK have squatted at one time or another, it says.

Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.

The Empty Homes Agency, an independent charity group that campaigns for empty homes to be used for those in need, estimates that there are currently 610,000 empty homes in England. About one-third of these homes have been empty for six or more months, it says.

But since it's now illegal to squat in residential properties, empty or not, squatters have turned to London's disused commercial buildings, many of which have been left empty long-term.

When squatters move in, they bring a new life to the space, often surprising in its incongruity. In one of Kern's photographs, taken inside the disused fabric warehouse, a man rests on a shelf used for storing rolls of cloth. He's hard to spot at first among the jumble of multicolored fabric.

Other images show ""The Castle,"" a former five-story office block in central London that is now a home for more than 100 squatters -- and a site for raves. Graffiti covers the walls, and party detritus is scattered across the floor where office workers once walked.

Another of Kern's photographs, taken in a squat in a former cabaret restaurant, shows a young man and woman, semi-clothed and hard at work to repair and alter their surroundings using cloth and wood.

For her project, Kern says, she used only a wide-angle lens to reflect the closeness of her subjects. ""The use of natural light adds to a candid feel,"" she said, adding to the authenticity of the images.

""I visually tried to convey the very different vibes of the squats that became homes, according to both their residents and the nature of the occupied spaces. Especially for the squat that I stayed at, I focused largely on the communal lifestyle in order to convey a sense of home.""

Far from encountering resistance as she ventured into people's intimate space, Kern says she made many friends. This was in part because she won people's trust by living among them -- but also because her project aimed to celebrate the positive aspects of their lifestyle rather than reinforce the negative stereotypes of squatters as wasters, tax dodgers or down-and-outs.

""My fellow squatters knew that I was a photographer documenting the squatting lifestyle, since I was always carrying my camera with me,"" she said.

""The squatters were very welcoming when I first met them, became my friends, hence the majority reacted positively towards me taking photographs.""

Despite the privations that come with squatting in buildings that often have no electricity or running water, Kern says she would do it again -- although she wants to try out the many other alternative lifestyles out there first.

From her images and her words, it's clear she found her time in a squat an overwhelmingly rewarding experience.

""You may not have a shower, but you may gain the most amazing rooftop views,"" she writes. ""You may have to share your room with seven other people, but you may share your happiest moments with them. You may have to move 10 times a year, but the diverse places and people you meet become an integral part of your journey through life, turning it into anything but ordinary."""
http://cnn.com,A glimpse of life on the reservation,"Story highlights German photographer Felix von der Osten spent time at an Indian reservation in Montana

He set out to show the ""beauty and richness of the culture"" and arouse curiosity in viewers

(CNN) Growing up in Germany, everything Felix von der Osten learned about Native Americans came from the books of 19th-century German writer Karl May.

May's most beloved characters, a noble Apache leader named Winnetou and his cowboy blood brother Old Shatterhand, are said to be more popular today in Germany than the works of Thomas Mann, the 20th-century Nobel Prize-winning author of ""Death in Venice.""

It wasn't until von der Osten drove through South Dakota last year, bearing witness to modest homes and trailers on tribal land in the majestic Black Hills, that he realized how one-dimensional his perceptions were.

Intrigued, the 25-year-old photographer began researching Native American history. What he learned about its brutal conquest and fraught modern existence inspired him to return to Indian Country to capture the good, the bad and the ugly.

""I wanted to show a slice of life (through) the beauty and richness of the culture,"" he said. ""I didn't want to do reportage. I wanted to do slow and thoughtful photographs, like historical documents.""

http://cnn.com,Giving a face to Sudan's refugee crisis,"But he never experienced any like the Mayo camp, which is outside the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.

Ten Hoopen was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for Emergency, a humanitarian group from Italy. He also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there.

His hopes were dashed, however, when he was told he couldn't photograph outside the hospital compound.

""I had very, very hard restrictions from the Sudanese government. ... They are very well-skilled in keeping the media at bay,"" ten Hoopen said.

With no freedom of movement, much like the refugees themselves, ten Hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in Africa. With the help of refugee hospital workers, he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available.

Photographer Pieter ten Hoopen

The studio quickly became a sensation. Once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken, lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken.

One by one, these people sat solemnly to be photographed. It was their time to be acknowledged. There was gravity, earnestness to the way they posed. This was the moment their story would be registered.

""This was one of the reasons why I built the studio: to get more material and more narratives from the people,"" ten Hoopen said.

The project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees.

The photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp, some have been there for decades. Women wearing the traditional Sudanese tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped. From the Muslim north, women are fully covered -- a contrast to women from the Christian south, who we also see represented in these photos.

Whether from Sudan, South Sudan or Eritrea, the faces become, individually and collectively, a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the Horn of Africa.

Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.

The word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict, their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs. Ten Hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely.

""They got very serious, they sat down upright. ... I tried to say as little as possible,"" he said. ""I do believe in their own expressions, their own narrative ... and their unique perspective.""

The studio had a comforting effect. It was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital. It gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye, giving each person their deserved attention. Aesthetically, it created an aura around each person, beaming light on his or her personal narrative. It had some uplifting effects as well.

""I always try to put some extra thought to (projects). So I build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the African continent or in Europe ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way,"" ten Hoopen said.

He said some patients at the hospital ""had being laying there for months in their room. ... Then you take them out, it's a little treat to get them out of their own misery. ... That's why you see the line growing, because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio.""

I build classic photo studios ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way. Pieter ten Hoopen

Ten-month-old Buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio. Having just had a blood test for malaria, she clearly looked uneasy. Gazing to someone who is holding her hand, her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength.

Hawa Haranan, 40, came from the war-torn Darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital. As she wears a simple tobe, one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare. Her life and struggle, as with the other individuals photographed, is accounted for with the testimony of a camera.

Ten Hoopen used tilt-shift lenses, which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography.

""I really can appreciate old portraiture ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded, I think, with respect and it was a very serious moment,"" he said. ""It's a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you.""

How did ten Hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees, some severely traumatized and living in fear?

""It wasn't hard,"" he said. ""I just told them to relax and have fun.

""Kids sometimes got nervous, and I don't blame them. I am a tall, white, bald European guy. ... I am not only funny to look at, but it is hot in that country so I am usually very red when I am photographing. ... I have tattoos everywhere. ... They thought I was a quite interesting creature."""
http://cnn.com,Needy families slept on hospital floors until one doctor started a shelter,"Lima, Peru (CNN) As part of his medical training, Dr. Ricardo Pun-Chong spent time doing rounds in hospitals throughout Lima, the capital of Peru.

Day after day, he noticed families sleeping on the floors.

Many of them, he learned, had come from faraway villages, with little or no money, to get medical treatment for their children.

Navigating the country's difficult terrain -- which spans the Andes Mountains to the Amazon -- often means traversing unpaved roads and can make for a dangerous trip.

""The journey, it's very difficult,"" Pun-Chong said. ""People have to cross the mountains or take a boat to cross the river. It can take many days. Just imagine having this trip with a kid with cancer.""

Far from home and loved ones, and unable to pay for a place to stay in Lima, many families found themselves homeless while fighting for their children's lives.

""I couldn't get the picture of the families sleeping on the floor out of my mind,"" Pun-Chong said. ""So, I decided to do something for them.""

Since 2008, Pun-Chong's nonprofit, Inspira , has provided free housing, meals and overall support for sick children and their families while they undergo treatment. The organization has helped more than 900 families who've come from all over Peru.

Pun-Chong, who lives a few blocks from the shelter and is there almost every day, runs the organization with the help of a small staff and an army of passionate volunteers. He spends every holiday with the families there.

""The kids inspire me every day,"" Pun-Chong said. ""When I'm with these kids, and I feel how strong they are, I understand that there are no problems that we can't resolve.""

CNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Pun-Chong about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: What are some of the obstacles facing these families?

Ricardo Pun-Chong: We have people who come from the Amazon, travel on a boat and from there take a bus. And you're with a sick child, with a fever. Once they reach the city, they don't have any resources. Sometimes they don't even speak Spanish; they speak Quechua, Aymara or other dialects.

For leukemia, the most frequent cancer in kids, the first treatment is about six months. But to stay here is too expensive. Sometimes families, they have to sell everything they have. They feel helpless. They feel really alone. They either have to make it work and stay, or they make the difficult trip back home without their children receiving full treatment.

CNN: What kind of environment have you created at the shelter?

Pun-Chong: The shelter is a very special place. We not only wanted people to have a place to sleep and food to eat, we also wanted to create a space to help the kids be cured. It's a place with a lot of love.

I don't want it to feel like a house, I want it to feel like a home. In the shelter we don't have TV because I prefer to talk to the kids and teach them how to create things. I want them to use their imagination.

The families can stay in our shelter as long as they need, and I want them to know they are not alone, there are a lot of people that are with them.

CNN: What is the unique approach you take with the children?

Pun-Chong: Here we live the day-to-day, but we don't talk about tumors and surgeries and cancer. When I go to the shelter, I leave my stethoscope at home. I come in here as Ricardo, not as a doctor. I want each and every one of them to feel special. I try to lift the spirits of these kids who probably have just undergone surgery. I play and have fun with them and make sure that during this hard time, these kids get to just act like kids.

We are doing everything we can to connect and engage with them. We listen to stories, color, paint, play in the park, ride bicycles. We try to give these kids special things and special experiences. I try to make them laugh, to enjoy themselves. I want these kids to play, to learn, to share. I want to help them to be the happiest they can be.

http://cnn.com,"From tourist to altruist, how a New Yorker embraced Vietnam","Hoi An, Vietnam (CNN) New Yorker Neal Bermas had traveled around the world, but Vietnam literally stopped him in his tracks.

There, the businessman saw starving children in Ho Chi Minh City while on a trip to Asia in 1999.

""There were bands of these poor, homeless kids on the streets ... and they were begging for milk, not for money,"" Bermas said. ""It stayed with me.""

Bermas, who did consulting for hotels and restaurants, saw there was an effort under way to help street kids get simple food service jobs. He realized he could help.

Combining his business savvy with an ambitious nonprofit model, in 2007 he co-founded STREETS International , based in Hoi An. The organization provides at-risk young people with a rigorous 18-month training program, preparing them for careers in Vietnam's booming culinary and hospitality industries.

""(They) come from the whole country with all kinds of very, very difficult paths,"" Bermas said. ""We offer them a structured program and a very rich apprenticing experience.""

STREETS' participants range in age from 16 to 22. The group provides housing, meals, medical care, clothing and support services to help trainees gain skills and confidence for employment at top resorts.

Some come from more than 600 miles away to participate in the free program. They receive a stipend and transportation assistance to visit their family.

""We build possibilities and aspirations for those communities,"" Bermas said. ""Where we take one young person from the village, suddenly ... the whole village starts to think about, 'maybe my kid, too.'""

Currently, 75 trainees are enrolled. The group's full-time staff and teachers are all Vietnamese, and Bermas often brings in chefs and other experts to enhance the training.

He and his team work with the government and ensure they follow all safety and labor laws and regulations.

JUST WATCHED CNN Hero Neal Bermas: 'Oodles of Noodles' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Neal Bermas: 'Oodles of Noodles' 02:39

By the end of this year, nearly 250 young people will have completed the program. Bermas said 100% of STREETS graduates have found employment, mostly at four- and five-star hotels in Vietnam.

""It works. And that's a push to do more to reach more young people,"" he said, adding that the group stays in regular contact with all graduates for at least two years after graduation, most longer.

Bermas plans to expand the program to other areas of the country.

CNN's Allie Torgan spoke with Bermas about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: Who are the young people applying to your program?

Bermas: All the young people in our program come from poverty -- without enough to eat, without electricity and plumbing. From leprosy villages, from HIV backgrounds; some have been trafficked, sometimes more than once.

Part of the process of selecting and getting to know the trainees is that we visit wherever they're from -- the home, in many cases the orphanage, the NGO, the isolated village, sometimes even a street corner. We want to know the most about them we possibly can, how difficult their conditions have been and how they have been wounded by life. Or what support there is. It's a great resource to a young person's development in our program.

This is the first real chance for many (of them) to transition from poverty and life on the streets to the dignity of self-sufficiency that comes with a successful career. You shouldn't discount a young person's future because of their past, no matter how dire it's been.

CNN: You've created an extensive program. Besides the hands-on culinary and hospitality training, what else is involved?

Bermas: There's a whole team of colleagues, educators and professionals who have worked developing all this. We have daily curriculums and lesson plans, from the first day to the last day -- designed to deliver quite sophisticated, substantive material.

We have a computer language lab. We have tutoring every day of the week. English language instruction is a big part. And a whole array of life skills, from hygiene to CPR, budgeting and banking, physical exercise and being healthy.

Depending on which track the trainees are going, they have classroom experience in a small teaching kitchen if they're becoming professional chefs, or in the classroom to learn about hospitality and service. And our three eateries have many purposes; each one brings a different set of skills for apprenticing.

CNN: You left Manhattan behind to do this. Why did you decide to move to Vietnam?

Bermas: The truth is, the early vision was that I would work with colleagues and assemble a team here. And I could travel back and forth and make sure everything was going well.

It became clear very early on that if I was to really realize this ambition on behalf of the young people in the program, I would have to be here and do it. It was probably the best, if not certainly the most meaningful, decision I've made in my adult life.

This work at STREETS is never easy, but it's important. I know now that I need to be sure there is a STREETS around 10 years from now.

CNN: You've kept your focus on the local community. How have they embraced you?

Bermas: It's traditional here in Vietnam when you open a new business that the business community and friends and family all send you large wreaths of flowers opening day to wish you good luck.

The day we opened the restaurant -- we'd been working so hard to open, to get this thing going -- and I came down the street, and there were so many of these big, beautiful wreaths full of flowers that said in Vietnamese, ""Congratulations"" and ""Welcome."" And who had sent them? All the local shops and friends we had made. I was so touched by this.

The flowers poured out into the street. It was amazing. I literally couldn't get in the front door of the restaurant.

http://cnn.com,"At 17, this sexual abuse survivor set out to fix a broken system","Cochabamba, Bolivia (CNN) Brisa De Angulo grew up in Bolivia and remembers having a wonderful childhood. That is, until she was 15.

That's when she suffered repeated sexual abuse by an adult in her extended family.

His threats to hurt other family members silenced her. She fell into a deep depression, dropped out of school and developed an eating disorder. She made multiple suicide attempts.

When she finally gained the courage to tell her parents about the abuse, they reported it to the police and took the case to court. But they had trouble finding a lawyer willing to take the case. Members of her community worked to silence her. Her home was set on fire twice, and people tried to run her down with their cars.

""There was a lot of pressure for me to stay silent, but I just couldn't stay silent,"" said De Angulo, now 30. ""I found out that I wasn't alone, that there were tons of girls that were also being sexually abused, and I had to do something.""

Of the 12 countries that make up South America, Bolivia has the highest rates of sexual violence against women -- with seven in 10 women experiencing it in their lifetime.

In 2004, at 17 years old, De Angulo established Fundación Una Brisa de Esperanza -- or A Breeze of Hope Foundation . At its center in Cochabamba, Bolivia, the group provides free and comprehensive psychological, legal, medical and social services for child and adolescent survivors of sexual abuse.

""We work with the families...to see (the) child as a very powerful survivor, and to have the support that she needs so that she can take her case to court, and she can heal,"" De Angulo said.

The organization also advocates for legal reforms and policy changes for the rights of abuse survivors in Bolivia.

""I had to use the rest of my life to prevent other girls from going through what I went through,"" said De Angulo, whose extensive team has assisted about 1,500 young survivors.

CNN spoke with De Angulo about her work. Below is an edited version of the conversation.

CNN: Sexual violence has long been prevalent in Bolivia. What are the cultural stereotypes you're working to combat?

Brisa De Angulo: We see it a lot in Bolivia, that a woman is seen as having less value than men, and that starts even before the baby is born. If it's a boy, then you're in this culture of being more aggressive, the one who has control. If you're a girl, then you're this one who has to be submissive, not make problems and sit quietly. Even from a very young age, their path is already set.

We need to start changing that mentality so that they can be born in a context where they will be seen as equal. One of our most powerful ways of challenging the machismo culture is to work with pregnant women, to work with that family, to start challenging the stereotypical roles.

We also work a lot with prevention by giving workshops, training people -- people from government, police officers, judges, prosecutors, children in school.

CNN: Your experiences inspired you to pursue your law degree. What impact has your organization's legal efforts had?

De Angulo: When I went to the authorities, I was blamed for what happened to me, I was questioned for many hours. I was told that I was insensitive for wanting to put a man in jail, for wanting to destroy my family. I was one of the first adolescents in Bolivia to take my case to court, but the judges didn't want to take my case.

When we started the program, the conviction rate for sexual crimes was .02 percent. From the hundreds of cases that we've taken to court, we have a 95 percent conviction rate.

When I was taking my case to court, at the time, it was normal for an aggressor to question the victim on trial. It wasn't a lawyer, it wasn't the judge; it was the aggressor. Through our work, we've proved that that is a human rights violation and have changed the law.

Another law is that if the aggressor married the victim, you couldn't take the aggressor to court for rape. That was being used to marry a 13-year-old with a 40-year-old just to make sure that this man will never be taken to court for rape crimes. Thanks to all our work and our push to the government, we have been able to overturn this law.

CNN: The country now has an annual Walk Against Sexual Violence. How did that come about?

De Angulo: August 9 was one of the hardest days of my life because it was the day I had to go to court and face my aggressor. I started telling my story and asking people if they would join me on a walk against sexual violence and use a blue ribbon, meaning that you were against sexual violence.

(The first year) I thought there were only going to be about 20 people who would join me. But that day, thousands of people showed up with a blue ribbon. August 9 was later declared the National Day Against Sexual Violence in Bolivia. Now thousands of people all around the country, in the most remote communities, march on August 9.

It's beautiful because sometimes you are walking in the street and you see someone with a blue ribbon and you just look at their eyes and you know that we're in this together. And you don't have to say any words, but you know that you're not alone.

http://cnn.com,a land where coffee meets tradition,"(CNN) As he tended to his goats one afternoon in the Ethiopian highlands some 12 centuries ago, a herder named Kaldi noticed that his bleating charges seemed energized after chewing mysterious red berries.

Intrigued by the strange reaction, Kaldi took the berries to a local monastery, where the monks promptly threw them in the fire disapproving of their apparently magical attributes.

As the berries were roasted by the heat, a heavenly aroma spread, and they were used to make the first coffee.

Or so the legend of coffee goes. What is more certain is that Ethiopia, widely regarded as the cradle of coffee, is a nation devoted to the stimulating beverage. The country is Africa's biggest producer and ranks fifth globally. Last year it exported 190,000 tonnes of coffee beans, earning around $700 million, and in 2016 Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa will host the 4th World Coffee Conference, a high-level gathering of global experts.

http://cnn.com,This man came home from the hospital to die. His son found a way to keep him alive,"London (CNN) When Suryakant ""Suri"" Nathwani returned from the hospital, the reserved 81-year-old grabbed his son's hand and pleaded to be allowed to die at home. ""He said, 'Please promise me one thing: If I'm going to go, I'm going to go here. Do not take me back there,'"" his son Raj Nathwani said.

Death was not an outcome Raj, 55, was willing to accept -- but he knew his father's chances of surviving coronavirus were not in his favor.

Raj had been tracking the virus since January, watching countless news reports: about the toll it had taken on multigenerational households; about medics in Italy's overstretched health system being too swamped to make home visits; about elderly people in China with pre-existing conditions -- including the one his father has -- having a higher chance of dying.

""I'm not a betting man, but if I was... [I would] definitely put my money on him not making it,"" Suri's family doctor, general practitioner Dr. Bharat Thacker, told CNN.

Raj Nathwani, his mother Kanchan, father Suryakant (Suri), and brother Manish (left to right). Suri survived Covid-19 despite his age and ill health.

The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 219,000 people worldwide, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University in the US.

But official death tolls are largely made up of patients who died in intensive care wards or other hospital departments. The number of people dying in the community -- many in their own homes or care homes -- are often under-reported

As he helped Suri up to bed after his arrival home from Watford General Hospital, on the outskirts of London, Raj worried whether the desperate series of events that had seen the virus spread across the globe would turn his father into another statistic.

Raj, a director of insight at an advertising firm, remained outwardly positive: ""You're not going to die. We're going to look after you here,"" he told his father. What he did not know was just how successful he would be.

The descent

Baby monitor footage shows Suri Nathwani using a CPAP machine in his home as he recovers from coronavirus.

Raj, who had himself recovered from a heart attack last November, was prepared for the pandemic weeks before the UK lockdown began on March 23. He had been in self-isolation alongside his 80-year-old mother and his father, who has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), since March 11, because the entire household was considered to be at high risk from coronavirus.

But his father's condition began to deteriorate on March 25. Suri's daily 10-minute walk outside the family home turned into a 45-minute stagger. His lung condition was flaring up. He looked fatigued, listless, and -- although he did not display the high temperature or persistent cough, which the NHS considered the main symptoms of the virus -- Raj suspected his father had Covid-19.

Unbeknownst to the family, Suri's lungs were filling with liquid -- a fact that was spotted by paramedics called to the family's home the following day, when the octogenarian had trouble breathing.

He was taken to hospital, but doctors called Raj shortly afterward. He says they told him they were 95% sure Suri had the virus, but that they wanted to discharge him and send him home.

Raj says a senior consultant told him that if Suri's condition worsened they would not ventilate him ""because he felt his lungs, with ... COPD, would not be able to handle it.""

CNN has reached out to Watford General Hospital for comment on Suri's case, but has not received a response. CNN has seen Suri's discharge sheet, which includes a ""do not resuscitate"" (DNR) order that was completed upon his admission.

Ventilation can be life-saving, but even in ordinary times, health practitioners warn that being admitted into intensive care gives no guarantee of recovery for older patients.

Suri's son Raj, an analytics specialist, created a spreadsheet to track his father's vital signs.

Raj said he was left with two choices: ""Do I keep him there and risk never seeing him again, or do I bring him home and spend all my energy making it comfortable for him?"" He chose the latter, even at the risk of spreading the infection through the entire household.

Before Suri returned to his Watford home -- in a local taxi, as there was no ambulance available to move him -- Raj spent the afternoon cleaning the house, isolating his mother on the ground floor, and turning his parents' first floor bedroom into a makeshift hospital ward.

With little medical knowledge, or advice from the hospital on how to administer palliative care, Raj resorted to doing what he did best: collecting and analyzing data. He created a Google spreadsheet to help track his father's temperature, blood pressure and oxygen saturation readings -- vitals that could be measured with a store-bought thermometer, blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter.

To limit the amount of time Raj spent in the room, an iPad was set up with a baby monitor app. This enabled the rest of his tight-knit family to help out, giving Raj's brother, Manish, who lives in the US, and his sons, who live nearby with their mother, the opportunity to check in on Suri, helping to ease his lonely isolation. It also meant they could take turns monitoring him when Raj needed to rest.

The strategist also turned to a family friend, a general practice doctor, for advice. The GP advised on Suri's hydration, and kept track of his vital signs on the Google spreadsheet.

Raj says that perhaps the key factor when it came to treating his father was the fact that their home was already equipped with a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP machine, for Suri's sleep apnea.

""When Dad's breathing got worse, I was advised to use the machine,"" he said, explaining that when his father's condition was at its most serious, the device -- which helps patients breathe more easily -- was being used for up to 16 hours a day on the doctor's advice.

Three days after he was discharged, Suri was delirious, struggling to eat, and told Raj he thought he was close to the end. Raj believes this was because his brain was being starved of oxygen.

The recovery

The following day, Dr. Thacker called with the news that Suri's coronavirus test had come back positive. At that point, many British GPs like Thacker were struggling to get hold of full personal protective equipment (PPE), such as a full-length gown and gloves.

Without PPE, it was unsafe for Thacker to make a home visit to coronavirus patients like Suri. ""If I went there and I got it, then not only are my family at risk, but so are my patients if I returned to the surgery,"" he told CNN.

Instead he checked the Google spreadsheet, and recommended an antibiotic for a secondary lung infection Suri had developed. The GP also advised that Suri should be helped to lie on his stomach for a number of hours a day -- a practice known as prone positioning. Doctors have found that placing the sickest coronavirus patients on their stomachs can help increase the amount of oxygen getting into their lungs.

Knowing the seriousness of Suri's condition, Thacker said a DNR notice was issued for the family's address so that any paramedics who were sent there knew not to resuscitate the man, since ""the outcome is going to be rather poor.""

Thankfully, it was not needed. Under his son's watchful eye, Suri gradually began to recover. Raj says he knew his father was on the road to recovery when he became strong enough to nag him. ""He began whingeing and said his tea was badly made. He then asked for some pizza and chips,"" Raj said.

Eventually, Suri was given the all-clear, and by last week, he was walking the length of his garden with the help of a zimmer frame, or walker -- inspired by Capt. Tom Moore, the 100-year-old British war veteran who has raised millions of pounds for the UK's National Health Service by walking 100 laps of his garden.

""We truly had an action and 'go-to' team on tap that I trusted,"" Raj said, adding he did not have to rely on ""Dr. Google,"" because he had real doctors nearby to help.

He said he appreciates that he and his father were in a more privileged position than many in the UK, where the virus is disproportionately affecting black and ethnic minority communities.

Thacker, who has had a number of patients die of Covid-19, says he cannot put his finger on exactly what worked for Suri.

""Whether it was the family caring for him, or the available bio-data that made the difference -- we don't know,"" he said, adding: ""Perhaps it was just luck and not quite his time to go.""

In the darkest moments, sometimes a plan of action and a little luck are the only things people have."
http://cnn.com,How America fell in and out of love with J. Crew,"Written by Allyssia Alleyne, CNN

Once the go-to brand for Michelle Obama, J. Crew has been a staple of the American fashion landscape for decades but in recent years it lost its footing. Now, with almost 500 stores worldwide currently shuttered by the coronavirus pandemic, J. Crew Group Inc. -- which operates J.Crew and Madewell -- filed for bankruptcy on Monday.

Reporting a $78.8 million net loss during its most recent fiscal year and burdened with more than $1 billion in debt , J. Crew's fall shouldn't come as a surprise. But to see the brand -- a mall mainstay across US -- reduced to this position still comes as a shock.

According to CEO Jan Singer ( formerly chief executive at Victoria's Secret ), the move is part of an ""ongoing process to transform our business with the goal of driving long-term, sustainable growth for J.Crew and further enhancing Madewell's growth momentum.""

J. Crew Group started as Popular Club Plan in 1947, a door-to-door business that sold inexpensive women's apparel. In 1983 the company relaunched as J. Crew, a catalog-only retailer, and positioned themselves as a cheaper alternative to Ralph Lauren. The first J. Crew store opened in 1989, in Manhattan, selling cheery American prepwear.

But it was about ten years ago that J. Crew really hit its stride -- changing its image from comfortable to chic, and becoming an inescapable part of the fashion landscape, from magazines and style blogs to the everywoman's wardrobe.

Under the stewardship of CEO and chairman Mickey Drexler (now chairman of the athletic apparel brand Outdoor Voices) and Jenna Lyons, who took over as creative director in 2008 and was promoted to president two years later, J. Crew came to epitomize a certain type of recession-era elegance.

Inspired by Lyons' own signature mix of casual designs and high-end pieces (she famously wore a feathered ball skirt and a slouchy beige sweater to the 2011 Met Gala), J.Crew sold pastel button-downs and perfectly draped T-shirts; sequinned blazers and oversized costume jewelry; jacquard trousers and distressed jeans.

Poppy campaigns fronted by Joan Smalls, Sasha Pivovarova, Amber Valletta, Lauren Hutton and other top models provided social media fodder. Lyons' approach was so widely embraced that, in 2013, the New York Times dubbed her ""The woman who dresses America."" The brand offered a more accessible kind luxury.

Celebrities like Jessica Alba, Blake Lively, Gwyneth Paltrow (a 2012 campaign star) and Reese Witherspoon were often spotted out in their J. Crew best. But their most influential celebrity fan was Michelle Obama.

Mirroring Lyons' high-low sensibility, Obama seemed to have the brand in constant rotation during her term as First Lady -- J. Crew leather gloves were paired with a lime Isabel Toledo ensemble at her husband's 2009 inauguration, a salmon skirt and sweater were worn in the pages of Vogue, pink pumps complemented a brocade dress by Tracy Reese at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.

Her influence led to both sold-out stock and stock market boosts: In a 2010 study, New York University professor David Yermack found that J. Crew's stock increased 25% after Obama wore J.Crew on ""The Tonight Show"" in October 2008.

But J. Crew has struggled to maintain that level of covetability in recent years, as once-devoted shoppers bemoaned the brand's increasingly eccentric designs and ever-climbing prices. In 2017, Lyons left the brand and was replaced by Johanna Uurasjarvi the following year. She was quickly replaced by Chris Benz, who was hired in early 2019. Neither was able to reignite interest in J.Crew.

Today, both Lyons' once-profitable eclectic preppiness and the brand's original argyle sweaters and prim chinos seem from a different time. In an era of gender-neutral dressing, streetwear and -- more recently -- lockdown loungewear, it appears trends and shoppers have moved on and J. Crew has not. Unfortunately, irrelevance comes at a high price."
http://cnn.com,Artists may need a Depression-era jobs program today,"Written by Ryan Prior, CNN

As the coronavirus pandemic drastically undermines the economy, arts administrator Deana Haggag finds herself in brand new territory.

Haggag, the president and CEO of United States Artists (USA), told CNN that a few weeks ago it became clear to her that ""most cultural organizations were going to be shut down."" She set in and just started ""monitoring the layoffs.""

In the art world, like in many sectors, the job losses were brutal.

""For many of us, we've never been here,"" Haggag said in a phone interview. ""This is the biggest crisis our country has faced in many of our lifetimes.""

She set to work behind the scenes to do something about it.

On Wednesday, her organization announced a $10 million collaborative grant program called Artist Relief . USA is working in coalition with six other major arts non-profits including Academy of American Poets, Artadia, Creative Capital, Foundation for Contemporary Arts, MAP Fund and the National YoungArts Foundation.

They're offering $5,000 grants to at least 100 artists per week, from poets to architects to weavers. They're hoping to be able to expand the program to more artists if funds allow.

She was deeply proud of getting so many organizations to agree on something so big so quickly.

""This is cause for celebration,"" she said. But at the same time, she acknowledged launching the program was bittersweet. ""Reading these applications is gut-wrenching, it's absolutely heart-breaking.""

She said in the first three hours, the group's portal received 2,200 applications from artists in need, and they expected to receive 10,000 on the first day.

From sound technicians to illustrators to ticket sellers, more than five million Americans are employed in the arts and culture sector, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

And programs like the one Haggag leads can only do so much to address the tidal wave of need.

The arts are indicative of the wider economic situation

April's unemployment numbers showed an historic spike in the number of Americans filing for unemployment. The Department of Labor said that for the week ending March 28, some 6.6 million Americans filed for benefits, a 3,000% spike over the claims numbers from last month. And businesses continue to lay off and furlough workers.

As we enter a global recession, it's worth a look back at how Americans rallied during previous times of economic hardship, and to consider how it might inform our response to our present dilemma.

Active from 1935 to 1943, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a New Deal program designed to give Americans paid work during the Great Depression while jobs were scarce.

The program would employ some 8.5 million Americans involved in 1.4 million public works projects, according to the Library of Congress

In addition to the nationwide infrastructure projects, for four of its years of existence the WPA housed Federal Project Number One. That project organized Depression-era work programs for thousands of artists, musicians, writers, theatrical performers and historians.

And its legacy goes beyond getting cultural workers back into employment.

The Works Progress Administration helped unemployed artists

The WPA would ""give some of the best writers of the 20th century their first job writing,"" author David A. Taylor told CNN over the phone.

Taylor penned the book ""Soul of a People: The WPA Writers' Project Uncovers Depression America,"" which was also turned into a documentary with the same title, chronicling one aspect of the WPA, the Federal Writers' Project.

That program alone employed as many as 7,500 people during its existence from 1935 to 1939.

The Writers' Project is perhaps best known for its American Guides, a series of locally written travel guides for cities and states.

Those on its payroll included would-be literary luminaries such as Richard Wright, Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison and Saul Bellow -- who would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.

During her time with the WPA, Hurston used her BA in anthropology to chronicle life histories in the American South. She wrote her classic novel ""Their Eyes Were Watching God,"" published in 1937, while doing her WPA-funded field work in Florida.

Ellisson's 1952 classic ""Invisible Man"" was drawn from character studies from his time interviewing people during his job on the Federal Writers' Project in the late 1930s, Taylor said.

The Federal Writers' Project also preserved histories of African American folklore and life that otherwise wouldn't have been recorded. Some are memorialized in the Slave Narrative Collection at the Library of Congress.

In the film ""Soul of a People,"" Maryemma Graham, a professor of English and African American Studies at the University of Kansas argues that ""the largest single impact on black writing before the civil rights movement was really the WPA, not the Harlem Renaissance.""

The WPA's Federal Art Project, Federal Theatre Project, Federal Music Project and Historical Records Survey employed Americans across the liberal arts spectrum.

In his early 20s, a pre-Hollywood Orson Welles directed a nationwide WPA-funded theatrical tour of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth,"" with an all African American cast.

Under the Federal Art Project, visual artists were often put to work creating murals or posters. Many of their works can be see via the New Deal Art Registry

Before they achieved wider recognition, the program provided a financial backstop for young visual artists such as Jackson Pollock , Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning, who would go on to become major art-world figures.

The iconic Griffiths Observatory in Los Angeles was built under the WPA.

Taylor pointed to novelist Nelson Algren's summation of the WPA's impact on artists and writers: ""Had it not been for the Project, the suicide rate would have been much higher. It gave new life to people who had thought their lives were over.""

It employed creative Americans during a crucial time

""It really built the world that generations experienced after World War II,"" Taylor said over the phone.

He added that if the current social distancing policies drive the economy into a prolonged recession, a larger economic program could be necessary.

""To the extent that government spends money on infrastructure, it should anticipate who we'll be when this is over,"" he said, emphasizing the need to see these types of programs not as spending, but rather as investments.

Today those necessary programs might include anything from broadband access and the electric grid to voting systems and social media projects.

""We need to imagine what life will be like when we emerge from social distancing and what we're going to need,"" he said.

And those programs can be tailored by sector to each person's individual skills. Noting a New Deal-era comment from his book, he said, ""There's no sense making a good violinist a bad ditch digger.""

The recent stimulus is a little different this time -- which could help artists

It's unclear how long or deep a coronavirus-related economic recession could last. But it might not be too early to think about how a new national arts job program might look.

So far, Congress has responded by passing Cares Act, a $2 trillion economic stimulus bill, the largest aid package in US history, and President Donald Trump signed the bill on March 27.

The bill has several major components, including direct stimulus checks to individuals, extension of unemployment benefits, small business grants, and loans to industry.

One key provision for artists was the extension of unemployment benefits for independent contractors who file their taxes on the IRS's 1099 forms. Many independent artists, those likely to be hit hardest by a faltering economy, fit into that tax category and are thereby eligible for benefits.

""Independent contractors aren't traditionally included in the stimulus,"" Jamie Bennett, the executive director of the non-profit ArtPlace America said over the phone. That's already a big step forward this time, helping everyone from blues guitarists to visual artists to Uber drivers.

""It was artists who invented the gig economy,"" Bennett said, noting that term's roots refer to jazz musicians playing shows.

Despite some good news around individual stimulus checks being sent as early as mid-April , and expanded unemployment benefits, the arts are uniquely vulnerable to social distancing guidelines.

""The vast majority of arts and culture is consumed in person with other people,"" Bennett said, explaining that a post-pandemic artistic renaissance will have to be scaled up slowly and carefully. It would start with small theaters or galleries, once public health officials give the green light, and society would only much later get back to filling large arenas for rock concerts and sporting events.

""We aren't going to flip a switch and have people immediately going back to sitting in a 1,200-seat theater,"" he said. ""It will require an 18-month strategy.""

In the meantime, arts institutions will need to beef up virtual offerings, and have faith that while valuable, visiting a museum or symphony performance via technologies like virtual reality or film wouldn't replace the joy of visiting those places.

""I am not someone who ever worries that technology will replace the live experience,"" Bennett said.

Virtual museum tours, unemployment checks, and direct stimulus aid are helpful Band-Aid solutions in the short term. But they're still short of the activist role the government played in actually creating artistic jobs nearly a century ago.

But for now, those measures may be the only thing that artists, and art institutions, have to rely on.

Various government programs can help

The coronavirus recession has different financial roots than the Great Depression, and stimulating the economy can't change the fact that some jobs simply can't be done while the pandemic is uncontrolled. But we can at least rely on public agencies and policies left in the wake of the New Deal, and a patchwork of civil society programs that weren't available in the Depression.

""The National Endowment for the Arts didn't exist in the 1930s,"" Taylor said. ""We don't have to start from scratch like the Federal Writers' Project did.""

Taylor said programs such as the American Journalism Project , a program that employs recent college graduates at local newspapers around the country, carry the spirit of the Federal Writers' Project.

A 21st century program from artists ""wouldn't have to look like the big monolithic program the WPA was,"" he said.

One ray of hope: last week, the Getty Trust also announced a $10 million relief fund to be released in amounts ranging from $25,000 to $200,000 by the California Community Foundation. Those grants would prop up small and midsize arts institutions.

Bennett, of ArtPlace America, said that community development block grants would likely be a key way to help agencies and organizations that can employ artists in projects ranging from community to public health campaigns , all vital to holding society together in the face of the pandemic.

Art can be a balm for the nation in troubled times

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and prominent fixture of the coronavirus response, told CNN's Sanjay Gupta he was worried about how this pandemic would affect the nation's psyche.

""I could hear it in the inflections in my daughters' voices when I speak with them on the phone,"" Fauci said. ""This is going to be imprinted on the personality of our nation for a very long time.""

""I think there's going to be some subliminal post-traumatic stress syndrome that we're all going to face,"" Fauci said.

While nearly everyone on the planet is feeling some version of what Fauci's daughter feels, it's unlikely that we can all enter therapy to sort through some of the complex emotions. Artists could help address those traumas in ways that healthcare professionals might not be able to.

""Art reminds you that you belong to others and helps you build an identity based on shared community,"" Haggag said. ""When we're done with this, we're going to need art and religion and also sports.""

""I don't know how we recover from the collective PTSD of this,"" Haggag said. ""I think we need to be together for that.""

Like so many aspects of the economy, from restaurants to travel to sports, the arts are strained in ways they've scarcely been before. While the situation is dire, it also directly feeds the new forms of creative expression that inevitably must come from social distancing.

Today, keeping expression -- and healing -- alive might entail investments that expand what art means under our current conditions, whether that be writing or video games or virtual reality.

""One of the things I find fascinating about the human condition is that under any circumstances, human beings will create,"" Bennett said. ""We haven't yet discovered conditions by which they stop being creative."""
http://cnn.com,Designing an end to a toxic American obsession: The Lawn,"Written by Matthew Ponsford

Lawns are an American obsession. Since the mass proliferation of suburbs in the 1950s and '60s, these pristine carpets of green turf have been meticulously maintained by suburbanites, with grass length and other aesthetic considerations enforced with bylaws and by homeowner associations.

But for nature, lawns offer little. Their maintenance produces more greenhouse gases than they absorb, and they are biodiversity deserts that have contributed to vanishing insect populations. Residential lawns cover 2% of US land and require more irrigation than any agricultural crop grown in the country. Across California, more than half of household water is used outside of the house.

If attitudes toward lawn care are shifted, however, these grassy green patches represent a gigantic opportunity. In 2005, a NASA satellite study found that American residential lawns take up 49,000 square miles (128,000 square km) -- nearly equal in size to the entire country of Greece.

According to environmental scientists, transforming lawns into miniature modular bio-reserves could not only boost biodiversity, but could cut water and petrol consumption and reduce the use of dangerous lawn chemicals.

Yet the question for many homeowners remains: how?

In Western states such as California, Colorado and Arizona, droughts have led to restrictions on water usage, forcing many to reconsider their thirsty lawns. Some inventive families and landscape architects have transformed yards, producing oases of life for hummingbirds, bees and butterflies, by employing scientific insight, design and imagination.

While many residents across the US may want a traditional patch of green carpet, Jodie Cook , a landscape designer from San Clemente, California, explained over email that West Coast homeowners are growing increasingly aware of how innovative models for lawns can benefit natural ecosystems, while providing a new dimension to the family home.

""This new garden model is giving people permission to play,"" said Cook, who has redesigned home lawns across Orange County, with an emphasis on ""ecosystem-centric"" design. Ripping up a generic lawn can reveal a canvas for personal creativity -- to plant with food, flowering plants and herbs, or to shape into wildlife habitats that invite in local fauna.

""It seems to me that they are yearning for an authentic experience of nature close to home,"" said Cook. There is increasing evidence that close contact with natural environments can reduce stress and anxiety, and even help maintain memory as we age.

According to Cook, the families she's worked with have been delighted to reconnect with eclectic natural processes, such as watching rain cascade down water-drainage swales. ""They don't want to travel to a wilderness park to see ecosystem interactions.""

Nationwide Trend

What Cook sees in California reflects an emerging trend across the country. In Minnesota, homeowners have been offered rebates to replace lawns with flowering plants beloved by bees. Cities and municipalities, such as Montgomery County in Maryland, have also offered to pay families and homeowner associations to design gardens that collect storm water in water features and underground rain barrels.

Such policies can lead to big changes. Images of intensely irrigated lawns in Phoenix, ringed by the red sand of the Arizona Desert, were once a disturbing case study of America's lawn addiction. But in recent decades, the state has taken action, charging more for water in the summer and banning lawns on new developments. At the turn of the millennium, 80% of Phoenix had green lawns, now only 14% does.

Landscape architects are seeing families change their preferences, according to a recent poll by the National Wildlife Federation's (NWF) Garden for Wildlife initiative, which encourages Americans to design gardens with food, water and shelter for wild animals.

In a 2018 poll by the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA), 83% of landscape architects said they were increasingly being asked about native plants, which provide better support for local ecosystems and are more drought-resistant. Last year, NWF surpassed its goal to register a million gardens nationwide to support pollinators.

Changing Tastes

Similarly, the nonprofit Green America has launched the Climate Victory Gardens initiative , which encourages people to plant ""regenerative"" food gardens. Inspired by the Home Victory Gardens that grew millions of tons of fresh fruits and vegetables during World War I and II. More than 2,300 families have started farming patches of garden to sequester carbon and increase soil fertility.

These gardens today represent around 3,600 acres. According to Green America, they have the potential over the next 10 years to capture the carbon equivalent to taking 70,000 cars off the road for an entire year.

San Diego-based landscape architect Katie Seidenwurm has documented a number of reasons behind the spike in interest in different types of gardens, including rising water costs and environmental responsibility.

""A lot of homeowners are more environmentally aware,"" said Seidenwurm over the phone, and she co-presented an ASLA talk last fall on recent residential garden trends with landscape architect Courtney Skybak , whose home city of Portland, Oregon, is another West Coast centre for experiments in environmental garden design. ""There's certificates that homeowners can get that certify that a front yard is wildlife friendly, or attracts butterflies, or is certified by master gardeners.""

""I think homeowners are trying to seek a higher sense of community, and so they want to be in their front yard, interacting with their neighbors,"" she added.

Faced with the choice between a wildlife garden or astroturf -- the latter has also become increasingly popular in drought-hit areas -- Mary Phillips, senior director of NWW, urges people to consider nature. She refers to recent research that shows wildlife gardens can support bee biodiversity comparable to natural parklands and, as a result, a greater number and diversity of birds, especially songbirds.

Yard, by 2.ink Studio, winner of the ASLA 2018 Professional Honor Award in Residential Design Credit: Stephen Miller / ASLA

""When we share those kinds of stories, that is what's motivating people,"" said Phillips. ""Because they're actually seeing on the ground, visually, these bees and these butterflies and the birds visiting the property, and they see that they can make a significant difference.""

A Few Simple Rules

Even small changes can make a difference to the environmental impact of lawns. The ""entry-level option,"" according to Philips, for families that still want room for their kids to play, is to inject more wildflowers into the turf. That includes plants that are typically viewed as nuisances.

""The stuff that people are usually trying to get out of their lawn, we're saying 'No, that's good to have in your lawn!'"" said Philips. ""So reintroduce native violets -- and even dandelions -- certain clovers, low-growing thyme and things that flower, which provide pollinator benefits and are better for the soil.""

Once a wasteland, Tessa Charnofsky planted hundreds of California native plants and built decks and stairways. ""Within a couple of years, it was transformed into a wildlife paradise, and became a Certified Wildlife Habitat. So many species of bumble bee and sweat bee, butterflies and moths, lizards, migrating birds, birds of pray lived here, dined here, or just passed through."" Credit: Tessa Charnofsky

The more advanced option means ""taller meadow or prairie-like native plants,"" Phillips said. These types of plants have root systems that better manage storm water runoff, in addition to absorbing more carbon, she explained.

When one home commits to a wildlife-friendly lawn, others often follow. ""(It's) an unspoken message to their neighbors, it is evidence that they care about the environment,"" Cook said. ""In many areas, the first house on the block has set off a domino effect, as others take permission to experiment.""c

""Each small garden acts as a stepping stone for birds, pollinators and other wildlife, becoming something much larger, impacting whole watersheds,"" she added.

There are lessons to be learned from landscaping projects both grand and small. ""There are no rules for what a garden should be,"" said LA landscape designer Naomi Sanders . In addition to being a beautiful space, gardens and lawns present opportunities for peaceful refuge, hosting and observing wildlife, learning and exploring, and connecting with neighbors and one's self. ""Perhaps more now than ever, most of us understand the importance of plants and nature and that we function within a larger natural environment.""

CNN Style has launched a dedicated Beauty section. Read more Beauty stories here

Wu Xiaochen said she was 14 when she had her first cosmetic procedure -- liposuction paid for by her mother to reduce fat from her thighs.

At the time, she said she had been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that required her to take glucocorticoids, a class of steroid hormones.

""I had put on a lot of weight and felt very uncomfortable in my skin,"" said Wu, now a 30-year-old model and entrepreneur based in Beijing. ""I felt so much more confident afterwards.""

In the 16 years since that first procedure, Wu claims to have had over 100 surgeries, costing a staggering 4 million yuan (about $574,000).

She is now a well-known advocate of the industry and has opened two beauty clinics offering cosmetic surgery in Beijing.

Wu's potential market is huge.

A growing number of Chinese women are using cosmetic surgery to achieve bigger eyes, high cheekbones, narrow noses and skinny legs. Like Wu, many are seeking to emulate a beauty ideal inspired by elements of Japan's manga comics, South Korea's K-Pop and Western culture.

In 2014, more than 7 million Chinese people had plastic surgery, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics. Just three years later, data compiled by Shanghai branch of Frost & Sullivan consultants suggested the figure was closer to 16.3 million.

According to experts interviewed by CNN, the surge in plastic surgery in China is in part due to a series of apps like So-Young and GengMei, which allow potential patients to view before and after photos, book surgeries and even apply for credit to pay for them.

""In China, it is very difficult to find reliable information on clinics, especially in smaller cities,"" explained Tony DeGennaro, co-founder of Dragon Social, a Chinese market intelligence agency. ""People no longer trust the search results returned by (search engine) Baidu, following several medical scandals involving the platform, so these new apps have taken over as unofficial directories of surgeons.""

'Not pretty enough'

Wu grew up in a middle-class family in Shenyang, a large industrial city in China's northeast. As a teen, she studied art and dreamed of becoming famous. An actress, or maybe a model.

But she thought she wasn't pretty enough and felt insecure about her ""small eyes and round face."" So after her first successful procedure she said she soon chose to have a facial liposuction -- to make her face look thinner by having some fat removed -- and then facial contouring surgery, to give it a more angular look by having silicone implants put into her cheekbones.

At 16, she said she had her nose bridge elevated, to make it appear taller and longer. This was followed by surgeries to give her jawline more of a V-shape, breast implants and a double eyelid procedure to add creases to her eyelids and make her eyes look larger. ""Every two or three years, I have a few more procedures done,"" she said. ""Surgery has become like an addiction for me.""

Many of the Chinese women having cosmetic surgery are young and living in the country's second and third tier cities, according to a white paper published in 2019 by So-Young, based on analysis of its own data and visits to clinics.

More than half are under the age of 26, the white paper said. To put that into perspective, cosmetic surgery patients under 30 years old make up a mere 6% of the total in the US.

For members of China's Generation Z, having cosmetic surgery is a way to stand out in an increasingly crowded dating scene and job market. ""China remains a very patriarchal society,"" said Brenda Alegre, a gender studies lecturer at Hong Kong University who has researched the cosmetic surgery trend. ""Being pretty is a way to ensure you will be successful at work and you will find a husband.""

The spread of internet culture, with attractive livestreaming hosts and photo apps like Meitu, which allow their users to enhance their selfies by removing imperfections, has also made plastic surgery more desirable. ""People seek to replicate in real life the effects they are getting with these apps,"" said Dr. Stephanie Lam, a plastic surgeon in Hong Kong.

Plastic surgery apps

Apps that match patients to surgeons and clinics are incredibly popular in China.

The largest one, GengMei, has 36 million users and lists almost 20,000 surgeons on its platform, a company spokeswoman confirmed. Tencent backed So-Young has 2.47 million monthly active users and nearly 6,000 surgeons listed, according to a So-Young spokesperson.

These apps provide testimonies of cosmetic surgery patients, with before and after pictures, as well as reviews of surgeons.

GengMei has an augmented reality feature that can analyze a face and give it a grade out of 100 based on criteria like its liveliness, attractiveness and symmetry. It then makes suggestions for cosmetic surgery improvements, such as having one's eyelids redone or getting fillers.

""Through the GengMei app, we can access all medical information about beauty without even leaving the house,"" said Wu.

""This is a reflection of our society's development and it's a microcosm of our lifestyle change.""

The app even gives users access to micro-loans through Alipay's lending service Huabei to pay for the surgery.

Special offers

During the summer holidays, a period when many young women undergo plastic surgeries to give themselves a new look before the school year starts, some clinics offer discounts and special packages, said Alegre, the Hong Kong University lecturer. ""Girls will have surgery in groups, to benefit from offers like three procedures for the price of two.""

In these clinics, double eyelid surgery can cost as little as 1,000 yuan ($142), according to DeGennaro, from Dragon Social.

Wealthier patients opt to go to clinics in South Korea, Thailand or Hong Kong to have procedures done, said Lam. ""They believe the doctors are more trustworthy abroad,"" she added.

One such clinic is high up in One Pacific Place, an office block built above a luxury mall in central Hong Kong. Decked out with beige sofas, avant-garde art and huge windows offering sprawling views onto the harbor, it looks more like a high-end spa than a clinic. But it is an outpost of Hong Kong Sanitorium & Hospital, one of the city's private medical facilities.

""We get many patients from mainland China,"" said Dr. Gordon Ma, who heads the hospital's Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery Centre. Among the younger ones, double eyelid surgery is the most popular procedure, he said.

""Some of these customers want to go as far as possible,"" he added. ""They don't just want to enhance their natural beauty, they want to alter their appearance in a noticeable and obvious manner.""

Finding a new look

With her big eyes, long straight nose and pouty mouth, Wu looks nothing like the shy teen seen in old family photos.

""For a long time, I was trying to copy Angelababy's face,"" she said, referring to a famous Chinese actress and model. ""But I progressively moved away from this template and began to develop my own look, by mixing and matching features that suit my personality and face.""

Now when she looks at herself in the mirror, she says she sees ""a better version of herself.""

The faces of Angelababy and Chinese actress Fan Bingbing have traditionally been used as references for young cosmetic surgery devotees.

Wu said it's because they embody the ""three courts and five eyes"" rule, which denotes that perfectly proportioned faces have a width of five eyes, and a length of three equal ""courts"": from the forehead to the brow, from brow to the nose tip, then nose tip to chin.

To get the look, some women may need surgery. Others turn to cheap and easy to reverse hyaluronic acid fillers.

""They can be used to plump up cheekbones, make a chin pointier or even heighten a nose, a procedure known as a liquid nose job,"" said Lam, the plastic surgeon.

Some women take it further and undergo major operations, such as using some of their rib or hip bones to make their noses sharper and longer, according to Lam.

But some Chinese cosmetic surgery patients have started to move away from these celebrity beauty ideals. ""They seek out more individualistic looks, for example a face with elf-like features or even a world-weary face with a lived-in quality to it,"" said DeGennaro.

Many of these new trends are apparent on GengMei. Among the most popular looks discussed on the app is an M-shaped lip, meaning a lower lip with a dimple in the middle.

One user said she decided to have hyaluronic acid injected into her lips to copy ""the M-shaped mouths"" of South Korean stars Yoon Eun-hye and Lee Sung-kyung.

Another sought-after look is described as a ""baby face."" It involves a full, round face with a smooth contour, a short chin, a prominent forehead, big eyes and a small button nose, according to descriptions posted on the app. Facial fillers, as well as eye and nose surgeries, are recommended to obtain the look.

Another popular topic on GengMei is how to make single eyelids more attractive, instead of resorting to double eyelid surgery. This can be achieved by elongating the upper eyelid and making sure they're not saggy or excessively thick, writes one user, referencing the single eyelids of Chinese model Liu Wen and Taiwanese star Jacklyn Wu Chien-lien. Some skin is removed from the inner and outer part of the eyelid, a procedure called canthoplasty.

Dangerous clinics

But not all surgeries are successful.

Chinese media regularly reports of cases of surgery patients who have suffered adverse effects or even died on the operating table. Cases of medical malpractice often occur in small unlicensed clinics lacking the required permits to carry out surgery.

""Some of these clinics use substandard fillers and anti-aging injectables with contaminants or fewer active parts than they should have,"" said Lam. She recalled a spate of cases in 2016 where Hong Kong patients went to China to have anti-aging injections and came back with botulism -- an illness caused by the botulinum toxin -- and ended up in intensive care with breathing difficulties.

Ma of the Hong Kong Sanitorium & Hospital regularly sees patients needing corrective surgery after going under the knife overseas, including in China. ""They will for example come in with an eye that can no longer close properly because of a botched double eyelid surgery,"" he said.

Beijing has started to crack down on unlicensed and unqualified clinics.

China's National Health Commission identified 2,772 cases of illegal plastic surgery, during a year-long operation that started in May 2017. This led to more than 1,200 criminal prosecutions, according to a government release . The commission is considering establishing a blacklist of dangerous surgeons, it said.

Wu has also had several bad experiences. ""One clinic in Beijing used an L-shaped mold to reshape my nose, but my skin was so stretched after the procedure that I could see light through it,"" she said. She said she had to have corrective surgery afterward.

Despite the risks, China is quickly catching up to the United States in terms of the total number of cosmetic procedures performed.

yuan ($52 million), according to By 2023, total revenue is expected to exceed 360 billionyuan ($52 million), according to So-Young's prospectus , which cites numbers from consultants Frost & Sullivan.

For Wu, the evidence of the industry's growth is all around her.

""Ten years ago it was difficult to find a person who had done plastic surgery but nowadays it's hard to find someone who hasn't done it,"" she said."
http://cnn.com,Menswear has never been so casual. So why is the image of a man in uniform still so alluring?,"Written by Paul Flynn, CNN

From Tom Cruise in ""Top Gun"" to Richard Gere in ""An Officer and a Gentleman,"" Hollywood has long-popularized the image of a man in regimented attire. And while menswear has never been more casual, references to the uniform are still present in contemporary collections today. So just what is it about a man in uniform?

From military, to work and sports, uniforms command attention, and the big screen has created a romanticized version of the men behind uniforms.

""Is it an authority thing?"" asked Luke Day, editor of GQ Style. ""Is it a dominance thing? I think ultimately there's a romantic ideal to uniforms because most men in uniforms are heroes.""

Many of the staple items usually found in a stereotypical man's wardrobe -- be it deck shoes, the MA1 bomber jacket, chinos, khakis, epaulettes, a parka or field coat -- are directly descendant of uniforms.

""All menswear is uniform,"" said Julian Ganio, menswear consultant for Fendi. ""It's so tribal, something that's planted in (a man's) brain.""

Standardized dressing has been created to bind people together, but also to set them apart from other groups. ""Men like to be part of a gang,"" said Ganio. ""We want to be with like-minded men. And we want to belong.""

Recently, British professor of fashion design Andrew Groves curated an exhibition titled ""Invisible Men,"" from the menswear archive for the University of Westminster. According to Groves, communication between men is dictated by ""unspoken (style) judgments,"" but the historic narrative behind how men came to dress the way they do remains unexplored territory.

The 170-piece show, which draws an alignment between uniform and fashion, is in part a showcase of the larger Westminster archive, as well as a smart retort to the dearth of menswear exhibits on the art and fashion calendar. ""At the recent Dior show [at the V&A museum],"" said Groves, ""there was no menswear. Nothing. The same at the McQueen.""

Groves took a prosaic approach when curating ""Invisible Men,"" by drawing on the seemingly invisible fashion of British men -- largely missing from museums -- and its roots in uniforms. For this exhibition, he chose to celebrate the style that begins on football terraces and in local pubs, the elements of which are passed down, from father to son, and then twisted to each new generation's tastes.

Groves himself is a Man City season ticket holder and he already knows of several Arsenal fan clubs who have booked tickets for ""Invisible Men,"" on account of its exhaustive archive of Stone Island and CP Company workwear. ""Men have a structure, which goes by unnoticed,"" said Groves, ""But other men notice it. It is a secret code.""

At the Spring-Summer 2020 Maison Margiela show, John Galliano caused a disruptive fashion moment by sending a model,who appeared on the verge of exploding with internal rage, dressed in a sailor-inspired jacket stomping down the runway, perhaps a nod to Brad Davis's mesmerizing role in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ""Querelle,"" a film about a young sailor.

""If you look at all the British design greats,"" said Day, ""they have regimented uniform detailing in so much of their work. McQueen was full of them.""

Just recently, British menswear's critically acclaimed designer Craig Green created the concierge's uniform for Andre Balacz's newly opened Standard Hotel in London.

Day attributes much of the interest in uniforms to iconic movie imagery men usually become familiar with while they're still young.

As part of his work, Day styles Take That and their former bandmate Robbie Williams. ""There hasn't been a mood board for a single Take That tour that hasn't included a picture of Terence Stamp in 'Far From The Madding Crowd,'"" he said. ""The proportions are so sexual. The broad shoulder and high narrow waist. The way [Stamp]'s military trousers are cut you get a long, lean thigh.""

The image of a man in uniform has often carried a certain sexual undercurrent. ""Think of the Fireman's Ball [episode] in 'Sex and the City,' or Channing Tatum in 'Magic Mike.'"" said Day. ""Uniforms are routinely fetishized. Every basic hen-night stripper has two fails safe costume changes: 'Here's the fireman. Here's the policeman,'"" he added.

Even Andrew Scott's clerical-collared ""Hot Priest"" character, in the award-winning British TV show ""Fleabag,"" recently provoked an international outpouring of love. As it happens, one of the items on display at ""Invisible Men"" is a clerical garment.

""What's lovely about a uniform is that you can be anonymous,"" said Groves, ""and yet it gives you a set of rules that you can break, which is so much a part of the British menswear story. A uniform allows you to do something naughty that you shouldn't do."""
http://cnn.com,Brazil's fashion industry has a diversity problem,"Written by Jorge Grimberg, CNN

In February, the Brazilian fashion industry made global headlines. Donata Meirelles , then fashion director at Vogue Brazil, was celebrating her 50th birthday in the predominantly black city of Salvador, Bahia. During the celebration, journalist Fabio Bernardo snapped a photo of Meirelles, who is white, sitting in a traditional throne-like chair flanked by two baianas (Afro-Brazilian women wearing white lace gowns and headpieces), which he then shared on Instagram.

To many who saw the post (which has since been deleted), the scene evoked colonial Brazil, when white elites ruled over black slaves.

""What happened there is what happens in this country built on racism, bodies, sweat, blood and black tears,"" Afro-Brazilian actress and activist Tais Araujo, Vogue Brazil's November 2018 cover star, posted to her Instagram account in the days following the event. ""This suffering is so naturalized that it is difficult for people who do not identify with the girls standing by the chair to feel what the black population feels. Everything becomes natural.""

While the party was not an official Vogue event, the backlash was enough to warrant Meirelles' resignation from the title just a few days after the event, and a public apology from the magazine, who wrote on Instagram that they hoped the discussions sparked by the incident had ""served as a learning opportunity."" (Both Meirelles and Vogue Brazil declined to be interviewed for this story.)

And it has: On social media and beyond, the industry and the public have been having long overdue conversations about race and representation in Brazil's fashion community.

According to a Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics study released in 2016, 54% of Brazilians identify as black or multiracial. And yet black people have been all but erased from the mainstream fashion industry -- in front of the camera, on the catwalk and behind the scenes.

Historically, model diversity at São Paulo Fashion Week has been so low that in 2009, following intense pressure from anti-racism activists and state prosecutors, the organizing body mandated that 10% of models in each show must be black.

At last edition of São Paulo Fashion Week (SPFW), which took place in April month, black models were still in the minority, and for the last three seasons, only one black designer -- Luiz Claudio of Apartamento 03 -- has participated. (SPFW CEO Paulo Borges told CNN that organizers are aware of the disparity and are discussing ways to bring in new players.)

Why model Leomie Anderson is fighting for change

""In a country where most of the population is black, it's troubling to think that fashion, one of the most important vehicles of cultural and social expression, excludes such large numbers of creators and consumers,"" Afro-Brazilian artist and fashion designer Carol Barreto, who teaches gender studies at the Federal University of Bahia, said in an email.

""The entertainment world is highly susceptible to reproducing stereotypes, so it's important to study the limits and latitudes imposed when dealing with questions of race,"" she continued, because the propagation of negative images can contribute to perceptions of Black people as inferior.

Juliano Corbetta, founder and editor-in-chief of the online menswear publication Made in Brazil, has witnessed how racial inequality in Brazil can affect a magazine financially.

In early 2018, Corbetta set out to publish an issue that was would feature predominantly black talent (including producers, photographers and models) to inspire ""16-year-old kids dreaming of breaking into a fashion career."" Though he had no trouble finding talent to fill the pages, he was frustrated by how difficult it was to secure the advertisements needed to fund the issue.

""Reality hit. For the first time in nine years in publishing, everyone declined. No one wanted to include this (magazine) in their 2019 plans,"" Corbetta said. Many brands, he claims, told him an all-black issue wouldn't resonate with their audience.

He connects the issue to the fact that, in Brazil, discussing race and racism is still widely taboo. ""We never talk about apartheid. We didn't have a Martin Luther King. We didn't have a Rosa Parks. We didn't have an actual militant anti-racism movement. We have never talked about prejudice, even though it exists, so brands don't talk about it either.""

In this landscape, Brazil's black creatives -- like many marginalized groups around the world -- are increasingly turning to the internet and social media to create spaces for themselves in response to a lack of mainstream opportunity.

This was the route taken by Luiza Brasil, a Rio de Janeiro-based influencer and columnist for the Brazilian edition of Glamour. In 2015, she created Mequetrefismos, an online fashion, beauty and lifestyle publication, to promote the work of black people working within those fields; and, as a curator for the Casa Ipanema lifestyle boutique in Rio, has brought brands runs by black women to the forefront.

""We see more black people featured on magazine covers and in advertisements for luxury stores, but who are the people behind these campaigns? (The fact that they are usually white) says a lot about the lack of black people in organizations and leadership roles,"" Brasil said in a WhatsApp message. ""The black population is in the majority -- at 54% -- but our narratives have always been constructed by white people.""

""I think the Afro-Brazilian (empowerment) movement has always existed, but it's always been invisible. With the help of the internet, the Afro-Brazilian movement has gained momentum.""

Kevin David, a 25-year-old based in São Paulo, agrees. As executive creative director of MOOC , a Black-run creative collective, he's used the power of social media to land youth-oriented collaborative campaigns with the likes of Levi's, Converse, GQ Brazil and Schutz.

""There are fewer opportunities (for black creatives), but we are taking over. We have entered the market ... Weren't happy with the way the market was treating us,"" David said. ""We didn't want anyone else to tell our story. We wanted to take action and show that we believe representation means at this moment in Brazil.""

Brasil believes that the ongoing empowerment black creatives in the digital sphere will help challenge existing narratives and give Brazil more complex, diverse representations of black identity -- within Afro-Brazilian communities and in the mainstream.

""We no longer only represent an image of the ghetto, of blacks speaking only to blacks, but an important snapshot of society and our media in general"", she said.

http://cnn.com,Fashion gaffes are a reflection of the industry's diversity problem,"Written by Aileen Kwun, CNN Contributors Oscar Holland, CNN Stephy Chung, CNN

Last month, fashion house Chanel appointed its first head of diversity and inclusion. Announcing the hire, the French brand said it hoped to provide ""momentum"" for its ""existing diversity and inclusion approach.""

The move marked Chanel's entry into a new race in the world of luxury fashion: the race to hire more diverse talents, and thus lessen the chance of becoming the latest brand to alienate potential customers with racially or culturally insensitive gaffes.

About two weeks later, Gucci then appointed a new global head of diversity, equity and inclusion in order to ""create a more inclusive and equitable workplace and increase workforce diversity."" Prada and Burberry, too, have created a similar position in recent months.

These announcements all appear to be part of the fashion industry's response to accusations that it's out of touch with customers and society at large.

These missteps differ from one another in important ways. Burberry's noose touched on issues of mental health, while the Prada outrage was a matter of race. Gucci's turban, or its balaclava sweater resembling blackface (pictured top), generated backlash in existing markets, while D&G's ads alienated new ones. But what they collectively reveal is that the fashion industry is struggling -- at times -- to keep up with tech-savvy consumers who are ready to call out companies in real-time for insensitive imagery.

Hiring diversity advocates might seem like a sensible way to address fashion's troubling tendency to use stereotypes or cultural appropriation to turn a profit. But the new Chanel appointment has not been without its own controversy: Many on social media expressed their dismay that a white woman, Fiona Pargeter, had been named to the role.

Teen Vogue's fashion and beauty features director Tahirah Hairston took to Twitter to ask , ""why did chanel hire a white woman to be over diversity and inclusion? who is in that room?""

Another user wrote: ""white privilege is hiring a Head of Diversity and Inclusion who isn't a POC @CHANEL.""

In a statement e-mailed to CNN, Chanel said Pargeter's appointment ""is a sign of our commitment to D&I (diversity and inclusion) and its importance to the House.""

The brand declined to comment on questions about its decision to hire Pargeter at a time when fashion industry statistics show that people of color are far less likely to be hired for influential roles than white people. In 2018, The Business of Fashion found diversity to be lacking at the highest levels of leadership after studying 15 of the largest public companies in fashion.

From the outside, it seems obvious that hiring a white woman to lead diversity efforts might elicit a backlash. The blackface and chopstick gaffes seemed even more predictable, playing on racist tropes that have circulated for centuries. So why do they keep happening?

Fashion's new watchdogs

With designers and brands now contending with instant reactions from social media and a 24-hour news cycle, the backlash has become a fierce, tangible force with real consequences for sales.

Fashion's watchdogs -- once a select group of buyers and editors at closed-door runway shows -- are now online influencers and social media accounts, followed by people who might not even buy luxury brands, but are nonetheless vocal critics in cultural debates over ethics and representation.

Take the snarky Diet Prada , an Instagram account (with a cult following of 1.5 million ""Dieters"") that calls out copycat scandals and hypocrisy in the fashion industry. It has been credited with, among other things, fanning the flames of D&G's self-inflicted woes.

Social media has spread fashion -- and its critique -- faster and wider. And the reputational risks of insensitive blunders are real, potentially prompting boycotts that can cost brands millions.

But controversial campaigns and products are nothing new in the industry. Fashion has a long, fraught history of systemic racism, explains Valerie Steele, chief curator and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.

The industry has been rife with biases and insensitivities toward underrepresented and marginalized groups. Blackface caricatures are images that have persisted since the 19th century, she noted, ""and in the 1920s and '30s, fashion companies would use the n-word, for example, to describe a particular shade of brown"" in marketing materials. ""It was a fairly common practice in the UK, not so much in the US.""

Meanwhile, stereotypical depictions of Asians can be traced back nearly a hundred years with the popularization of conical straw ""coolie"" hats -- a derogatory reference to Southeast Asian laborers that was later appeared to influence Dior's ""New Look"" headgear in the 1940s and again various 1970s Yves Saint Laurent collections inspired by Asia.

Sales of the YSL perfume ""Opium"" appeared to benefit from protests against the scent's name, which many felt trivialized China's painful history of drug abuse and the Opium Wars. The scandal created a notoriety that helped make the scent a bestseller.

""We certainly keep seeing gaffes today, and it leaves one flabbergasted,"" Steele said in a phone interview. ""How do these things even get greenlighted? Who in the world, for example, thought that D&G's ad campaign, insulting and patronizing the Chinese model, would appeal to a Chinese audience? It's absolutely absurd.""

While the D&G ad campaign incensed some viewers, it was Stefano Gabbana's alleged trail of offensive Instagram direct messages that spurred Chinese audiences to boycott the brand, leading a number of online retailers to pull the brand entirely. Gabbana denied sending the derogatory messages, but the damage had been done.

""The reality is, brands have to be more nuanced,"" Steele added. ""Not every form of cultural appropriation is, or needs to be, egregious. But some of them have proven to be deeply offensive, over and over again, and yet we keep seeing them.""

Why brands miss the mark

Whether the result of careless mistakes, willful ignorance or even a cynical ploy for headlines, the recent slew of fashion gaffes may not stem from a single cause. Yet, they share a common characteristic: brands pursuing profit at the expense of cultural sensitivity.

This is particularly the case in China, where European fashion houses are competing to court a new generation of wealthy shoppers.

Here, D&G is not alone in having upset potential customers. Earlier this year, Burberry faced criticism after it marked Chinese New Year with a series of family-portrait-style photos that were ridiculed as ""creepy"" by social media users.

Fashion is full of elaborate cultural code switch, reference and pastiche. In the race to corner new markets, brands have a history of charging in with limited knowledge of the local audiences they seek to entice.

This raises questions about the process that goes into formulating a campaign, and the resources allocated to researching the market.

Former Elle China editor, Ye Zi, also known as Leaf Greener , said the cultural divide between Western and Asian audiences must be bridged in order to move forward. The Beijing native now works as a creative consultant for brands like Chloé, helping to facilitate conversations between staff in Western headquarters and their colleagues in China, while offering insight into Chinese consumers.

She believes that fashion houses must look to hire people who live in, or have previously lived in, the countries and markets being targeted.

""These people should have knowledge of their own country, but also understand what's going on globally.

""With China and Western countries, there's a big gap,"" she said, noting that cultural misunderstandings can go both ways. ""Even (Beijing and Shanghai) can feel like two different cultures or countries. That's something most people outside of China wouldn't understand -- not to mention basic things like the number of dialects used here.""

Tapping the Chinese market is about more than its buying power, she added, suggesting that brands would benefit from showing more respect to their target audiences' cultures. She cited the Hermès-backed Chinese lifestyle brand, Shang Xia, founded by Shanghai-born Jiang Qiong Er, as an example of a smart business move -- one that allowed the French fashion giant to show respect for Chinese consumers, and a vested interest, both financial and cultural, in the country's traditional craftsmanship.

More than money

There is clearly no shortage of money at Europe's biggest fashion houses, and China's rise as the world's fastest-growing consumer market makes it the target of many new products and campaigns. Chinese consumers account for nearly a third of spending on luxury goods worldwide, according to a recent report by consultancy firm Bain & Company.

The D&G incident last November serves as a cautionary tale. It is difficult to calculate the amount of money a brand loses in the fallout of a scandal like this, but they can stand to lose millions if campaigns backfire and customers boycott. Within days of the private messages becoming public, one Chinese e-commerce site said it had removed nearly 60,000 D&G products. But understanding a foreign audience's culture isn't a matter of money, according to Steele.

Dolce & Gabbana forced to cancel show in China

If more Chinese people were involved in planning the D&G campaign, she said, there may not have been as many errors. ""Giving diverse voices a seat at the table isn't enough,"" she argued, saying that those employees also need to be valued and ""in a position that isn't threatened or penalized for speaking up.""

""You can't just have change in terms of representation, like a rainbow coalition on the runway,"" she said. ""You really have to have diversity in terms of who's in power: Who owns the company, who designs for the company, who does the advertising? You need diversity all the way through the entire power structure, not just the face of the brand.""

Steele and Greener both allude to a broader theory that links overseas missteps with offense caused by the people in headquarters in the West: that these gaffes all directly reflect homogeneity in fashion's upper echelons. Just as involving Chinese people may help heighten brands' sensitivity towards China, hiring more black people or Sikhs -- in London, Milan or New York -- might have stopped garments offending those communities from making it past the drawing board.

And the industry's problematic lack of diversity isn't just racial -- it may also reflect socioeconomic inequalities.

""Increasingly, you have to be rich to break into (fashion), because you're getting paid so little at the start, and are less likely to be able to afford unpaid internships,"" said Steele.

""On top of everything else, you have a climate which many people say is one of bullying and conformism, (and) which is hostile to anybody who does not fall within the parameters of whatever clique has the power to make decisions.""

This pervasive culture makes it easier for prejudices to go unchallenged, according to New York-based stylist Ashley Owens, who founded the independent art and fashion magazine Suited in 2015.

""Racism, sexism and homophobia are so ingrained that you actually have to be mentally fighting those biases within yourself constantly,"" she said in a phone interview. ""In order to really change that system, it takes individual, incremental change in the day to day.""

Steps toward accountability

Brands are slowly starting to recognize that they must embrace inclusion within their own ranks if they are to achieve global appeal.

In January, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and PVH, the parent company of brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, published a briefing on inclusivity and diversity, making an ethical and creative case for embracing both.

""The (American) fashion industry ... has so far struggled to reflect the country's diversity in its workforce across all levels,"" the briefing stated. ""It's crucial for our industry to understand that diversity and inclusion are not a trend, but the way every company should operate.""

As the report articulated, diversity is ""simply a measure of difference"" within a company -- be it race, age, gender, ability or sexual orientation -- while inclusion goes further, creating ""a climate in which diverse individuals come together to form a collective whole."" Only then, perhaps, will fashion house employees feel empowered to speak out against campaigns or products that are so obviously going to cause offense.

The current disconnect between diversity and inclusion in fashion's ivory tower is clear. The major players are, still, overwhelmingly white. Fewer than 4% of the Council of Fashion Designers of America's (CFDA) members listed on its website are black, and until the September 2018 issue, the cover of US Vogue had never been shot by an African-American photographer.

The industry is also overwhelmingly male. In the US, women may spend three times more on clothing than men, but only 14% of major brands are led by a female executive, according to a 2015 Business of Fashion survey of 50 global brands.

Remedies will take time, and the CFDA's report outlines a number of long-term goals. Attitudes within fashion may be no more offensive than in other homogenous industries, but its public-facing role exposes it to far greater scrutiny. For now, the threat of coordinated action spreading online may be the most powerful force keeping brands in check.

While no fashion house has explicitly blamed their transgressions on insufficient in-house diversity, their responses to controversy offer a tacit acceptance of its role. Shortly after Prada's blackface accessories were withdrawn, the brand announced that two influential African-American cultural figures, artist Theaster Gates and director Ava DuVernay, would lead a new advisory council that will ""elevate voices of color.""

And when Gucci withdrew the aforementioned balaclava sweater from sale, it published an apology alongside what it called a commitment to increase diversity throughout the organization. (It later launched the Gucci Changemakers program, with a particular focus on targeting African-American communities and youth, and announced a $5 million fund ""to support social change by investing in community-based programs.)

Burberry soon followed suit, announcing plans to establish employee councils focused on diversity and inclusion, and telling CNN by email that it is rolling out inclusive leadership workshops and mandatory unconscious bias training. Whether such initiatives bring about meaningful change remains to be seen.

But they are, at least, an attempt to right some of the industry's wrongs, rather than simply apologizing and pulling offensive items from the shelves.

http://cnn.com,Why Beijing's Serpentine Pavilion signals a new age for Chinese architecture,"Written by Aric Chen

Aric Chen is Lead Curator for Design and Architecture at M+ , the new museum of visual culture under construction in Hong Kong.

Upon first seeing digital renderings of architect Liu Jiakun's Serpentine Pavilion Beijing -- a row of 38 steel rods pulled taut by cables, like fishing poles bearing a formidable catch -- many were struck by its audacious simplicity.

As a first foray outside Britain for the Serpentine Gallery's hugely successful series of temporary pavilions (they have previously been built in London's Kensington Park and designed by heavyweight architects like Zaha Hadid, Sou Fujimoto and Bjarke Ingels) one might have anticipated a bit more flamboyance. Instead, Liu has given us something to think about.

We should have expected no less. The Chinese architect, now in his 60s, is rarely prone to showmanship, his stern demeanor only occasionally betrayed by a wry, playful streak. His previous work offers moments of sublime beauty: the play of water, concrete and light in his Luyeyuan Buddhist Sculpture Museum in Chengdu, the city which he's based, or the monumental, sun-dappled staircase of his Suzhou Imperial Kiln Museum

But mostly, Liu is known as an architect with the common touch. He unapologetically describes his work as ""low-tech,"" letting inexpensive materials and basic construction techniques speak for themselves.

""His projects engage with a local context, connecting Chinese public life and urban cultural space,"" said the Serpentine's artistic director, Hans Ulrich Obrist, in an e-mail.

Liu's buildings may be clever and impressive, but they are never pretentious. His style is often described as a form of architectural ""realism."" And as we near the tenth anniversary of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, his approach stands in stark contrast to an event that announced China's return as a global power.

Centered on the Bird's Nest stadium, that dazzling tangle of steel by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron and the now dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei (how times have changed), the Games served as a glaring reminder of architecture's power to represent and even shape a new epoch.

But as the Olympic fireworks lit up the Beijing sky, Liu was in Sichuan province where, just three months earlier, the magnitude-8.0 Wenchuan earthquake had devastated the countryside and killed almost 90,000 people . He and his studio aided recovery efforts by inventing a system that quickly turned rubble into usable bricks (Liu called them "" Rebirth Bricks "") while constructing an achingly humble memorial to a rural schoolgirl who had perished in the tragedy.

Shifting attitudes

A stone's throw from the Forbidden City, Liu's Serpentine Pavilion Beijing is almost perfectly aligned with the Bird's Nest along the capital's historically significant north-south axis. But the two structures are separated by more than just the decade between them -- they represent a shift in architectural priorities as well.

Even the most perfunctory glance at China's ever-expanding skylines offers enough evidence that the architecture of spectacle, with its kaleidoscopic contortions and gravity-defying acrobatics, is still in fashion. But beneath it all, the spotlight has pivoted towards approaches more rooted in Chinese culture.

Often small-scale and made using local materials, this is the architecture long practiced by Liu and the Pritzker Prize-winning Wang Shu , and increasingly by younger cohorts like Zhang Lei, Zhang Ke, and Xu Tiantian. Encouraged by everything from growing cultural self-assurance to government policies promoting rural development, their work is now emerging at the fore.

""He's the right architect at the right time,"" the Serpentine Gallery's CEO, Yana Peel, said of Liu in a phone interview.

According to Liu, his pavilion reflects the Confucian concept of ""junzi,"" a kind of morally cultivated self, as expressed in the metaphor of an archer's bow.

""I wanted it to give a sense of inner strength,"" he said by phone of the structure, which gently curves upwards at either end and is paved with the type of floor tiles once used in the Forbidden City. ""It's like an archer standing firm without firing a shot. It's pure force, but how you handle that force reflects your cultural attitude.""

Put another way, Liu's pavilion aims to reveal architecture at its most essential -- a visceral embodiment of potential energy held in elegant tension. But it's difficult not to also see, in the strain of its tightly-drawn posture, something more ominous about the growing controls over many aspects of Chinese life coming from the seat of power nearby (the Communist Party's headquarters stand adjacent to the Forbidden City).

Nonetheless, naming Liu as the designer of Beijing's inaugural Serpentine Pavilion was an inspired choice. Less than 20 years ago, Liu had become one of the very first architects to open a private practice in post-reform China, joining a field that was previously monopolized by state design institutes.

The country's architecture has had some catching up to do. But it says something about recent years that now we speak not only about how far it has to go, but of how far it has come."
http://cnn.com,Queen of the skies: The Boeing 747 is playing a hero's role during Covid-19 crisis,"(CNN) — During the week of April 21, there were just two passenger-carrying 747 jumbo jets flying around the world. The Covid-19 pandemic has made the Queen of the Skies an acutely endangered monarch.

But Her Majesty might just be having the finest moment of her reign.

As the pandemic continues to sweep the globe, it has catastrophically impacted airline operations. Restrictions on domestic and international flying have reduced schedules to a mere fraction of the thousands of flights that operated every day just a couple of months ago.

Accelerated retirement

Two-thirds of the world's fleet of jetliners -- almost 17,000 out of 26,000 aircraft -- have been placed in storage or permanently retired from service. The iconic 747, already dwindling in numbers at the world's airlines, has been hard hit by the pandemic, with all but a handful grounded and heading for retirement.

l e v a r t

With the passenger fleet largely idled, cargo that once moved unknowingly under our feet on wide-body passenger jets has to find its way to market some other way.

Airlines have scrambled to take out seats to perform rudimentary conversions of passenger planes to keep them earning money, but it's the freighter fleet that is carrying the heaviest load.

""When it comes to this pandemic, seeing a 747 Freighter land at an airport is like in an old western, when the cavalry rides in to help the people in distress,"" said Henry Harteveldt, travel industry analyst and founder of Atmosphere Research Group.

""The 747 is definitely playing a hero's role in moving essential cargo around the world in this crisis.""

Older versions of the quad-jet jumbo were already facing replacement by more efficient, smaller and newer two-engine wide-bodies from Boeing and Airbus. Airlines including Lufthansa and KLM have accelerated the retirement of their vintage 747s, a couple of years sooner than originally planned.

Just two passenger 747s were found to be roaming the skies during that week in April, out of a small group of 16 planes that were shown to still be ""in service,"" according to Cirium, an aviation data and analytics company. Before the pandemic hit, there were less than 200 of the passenger jumbos.

But now that the international transport of critical medical goods has become a daily news headline, cargo operators such as Silk Way Airlines, Atlas Air, Air Bridge Cargo and Cargolux -- hardly known to the traveling public before COVID-19 -- are the stars of logistical efforts to support first responders.

And they're all flying the Boeing 747F -- that's ""F"" for Freighter.

Moscow-based Air Bridge Cargo (ABC) has 17 747Fs -- four 747-400Fs and 13 newer 747-8Fs. As part of the Volga-Dnepr Group -- known for its massive Ukrainian AN-124 ex-military airlifters -- ABC's 747s are flying 15 hours a day.

An analysis of Flightradar24 tracking data by the aviation industry publication The Air Current found that ABC's operations in March had shot up 51% compared to the previous two months.

""Air cargo solutions have never been more important than they are now to global health services. Currently, our international teams dispatch multiple flights daily to ensure that vital medical supplies protect those in need,"" said Tatyana Arslanova, executive operating officer for ABC.

She points to the 747-8F's climate-controlled cargo holds as one of the big plane's assets.

""Its three compartments can have different temperature settings from 4 degrees Celsius to 29 degrees (39 F to 84 F), giving us extra opportunities to transport perishable cargo, such as temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals and life-saving medical equipment.""

""It's a gift that I can give back""

There are 286 747 Freighters of different models in service, making up about a quarter of the 1,152-aircraft fleet of wide-body, main-deck cargo planes, according to Cirium.

Captain Kelly Lepley commands UPS Airlines' two models of 747s -- the newest 747-8F, and the older 747-400F.

""You know that you're carrying lifesaving equipment down below, and you know it's going to make a difference to those who need it on the front lines. It's very humbling, and it's not something that I thought about when I started my aviation career 30 years ago. But now, I feel that it's a gift that I can give back, in a time of crisis,"" said Lepley in an interview with CNN Travel.

UPS has 28 747Fs in its fleet, with an additional 15 747-8Fs on order. As part of the fleet of 261 dedicated cargo aircraft, the airline has pressed its largest freighters into the fight against the pandemic.

""UPS was already well positioned to support efforts in moving critical supplies to areas needing it most,"" said Michelle Polk, spokesperson for UPS. ""With governments and public authorities classifying UPS as an essential service provider, the company is combining the flexibility of its global network to respond to the Coronavirus pandemic.""

Lepley said that the pandemic has changed the way crews spend their layovers during stops in their multi-day flight schedules.

""Being a pilot can be a lonely career. We're out on the road a great deal, away from our families. Now, we land, we go to our rooms, and we're not allowed to leave our rooms or socialize. A lot of the countries, at this moment, are fearful of what we can bring in, so to prevent that and to keep us safe, we're required to stay in our rooms.""

Anchorage, Alaska, where Lepley is based, became the world's busiest airport last weekend according to multiple reports, due to the ongoing influx of cargo freighters that use it as a stop along the way between Asia and North America.

Cargo planes, like all other aircraft, must balance a cargo load and fuel quantity against a plane's maximum payload, which all translates into the distance any flight can reach. Flights from the major cities in China to Anchorage take around 8.5 to 9 hours.

""We can easily do that and carry a full payload on a 747-8F,"" said Lepley.

Newest version capable of carrying 300,000 pounds of cargo

The newest version of the cargo 747 is based on the passenger model, the 747-8. At just over 250 feet, it's the longest of all the jumbos, with new engines and enhanced aerodynamics.

""It's just a beautiful airplane to fly. It's a very stable aircraft, very gentle, a graceful airplane,"" said Lepley. ""From the cockpit it's hard to imagine that you're flying something so big until you get off the airplane and look up at it and you say, 'I just flew this thing!'""

The Boeing 747 was launched over 50 years ago. Boeing

The freighter has a feature that gives the 747 its iconic profile. With the cockpit out of the way on the upper deck, the nose of the plane swings up, opening the full main deck for loading. The plane also has a main deck cargo door at the rear of the fuselage. Between the main deck and the belly cargo hold, a 747-8F can haul over 300,000 pounds of cargo.

A specialty of the Air Bridge Cargo, ""the nose cargo door gives us the opportunity to load off-size cargo,"" explained ABC's Arslanova. ""That enables us to carry extra-long pipes, diesel generators, compressors, pumps and other large and heavy offshore equipment.""

Over 50 years ago, Boeing expected that the 747 would be but a postscript in aviation history, with passengers soon flying on supersonic jets.

So Joe Sutter, the 747's chief engineer, and his team designed the jumbo to be converted into a freighter, with a main deck width that could handle two rows of eight-foot wide cargo containers and the swing-up nose that gives the 747 its distinctive ""hump.""

Over 1,500 deliveries later, the Queen of the Skies has displayed remarkable longevity.

""We knew it would play a role connecting the world 50 years later. We wouldn't have known that we would have this epic pandemic that would ground so much of the world, and affect almost every country,"" said Atmosphere's Harteveldt."
http://cnn.com,"Passenger fish, Bill Clinton, summer skiing and pretending to be a cowboy: A short biography in 9 cross-country trips","Editor's Note — David Allan is CNN's editorial director for Travel, Style, Science and Wellness.

(CNN) — I've crossed America, by land, nine times so far. Once by a series of buses, twice by train and the rest driving.

I've driven one-way with all three of my girlfriends (one was a fiancée at the time), once with a fish, once with a cat, one time was in tandem with a friend using pre-cellphone walkie-talkies, and another with my brother and a lifesized cutout of Bill Clinton. Five of these trips were with nearly everything I owned at the time.

While crossing the country I've read much of the related literature: Jack Kerouac's ""On the Road,"" John Steinbeck's ""Travels With Charley,"" Hunter S. Thompson's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" Robert Pirsig's ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,"" and my favorite, ""Blue Highways,"" by William Least-Heat Moon. In his book, Least-Heat Moon wrote, ""Maybe experience is like a globe -- you can't go the wrong way if you travel far enough.""

Like all those great books, there's not a single epic story from any of my journeys, but rather a string of special moments and unforgettable sights. And like all cross-country treks, mine were more about the unfolding than the beginning or end. My experiences are a highlight reel of memorable scenes, random lessons learned, and a perpetual, soul-fulfilling desire to go back and forth, again and again.

#1: Urban cowboy (1978)

When I was five years old, my mother frugally, creatively and in the spirit of true adventure, planned a summer cross-country trip by a series of Greyhound busses between Baltimore and Los Angeles, where we had extended family. We changed buses in various towns, sleeping on them except for one night in a motel.

Related content A guide to raising good men, by my mom

Some of my earliest memories are from that trip, a fuzzy mash-up of getting a pinata, the old tram tour of Universal Studios, falling asleep across two seats, and the motel pool. My Mom fondly recalls walking under the St. Louis Arch, a cruise on the Mississippi River and going to church in New Mexico.

It felt epic to me, not because I was so young, but because it was epic.

But my favorite story was retold to me by my mom, about the time I sat in front of her next to a boy about my age and he and I compared our life stories.

I spoke with confidence and authority about my life as a cowboy, how I lived on a farm and had cows (of course), and horses and such. He asked me questions about prairie livin', which I answered with the imagination required of a kid who actually lived in an apartment in downtown Baltimore.

My mom, stifling laughter behind us, never betrayed my alter ego. And I learned my first important lesson about travel: You can reinvent yourself.

#2 and #3: Northern exposure (1993)

My junior year of college I participated in a university exchange program that sent me to Fairbanks, Alaska to take classes and have other adventures. But I was just as excited by the three-day train rides from Washington DC to Seattle and back, purchased for under $300 on Amtrak's student discount.

My first night, somewhere in Kentucky, I was woken either by the cold or the police lights. I could see my breath reflected in the red and blue flashes streaming into the unlighted train car. The heat and electricity were turned off to preserve power. Other passengers were in stages of waking too.

Like a morbid game of telephone starting with an employee, word slowly passed around that the train had run over someone on the tracks. An ambulance came, and we sat for hours, literally in the dark about the person's fate.

On the Empire Builder between Chicago and Seattle I spent a lot of time in the observation car watching beautiful parts of the country unfold. The first sight of snowy Glacier National Park in Montana is breathtaking because you emerge from a tunnel into an area of the park you can't drive to, I was told. But the journey was inward focused too. I wrote in my journal, read the Upanishads and ""Motorcycle Maintenance."" I talked to a lot of cool people, but slept terribly because I couldn't afford a sleeper car.

Another night I was jostled awake again. I looked out my window at a huge moon reflecting on the Mississippi River. I had an epiphany just then about how the country, and the people in it, are beautiful.

#4: On the road (1994-95)

A year after Alaska, my college girlfriend, Anna, invited me on a cross-country drive to deliver a new car to her aunt in New Mexico and then take the aunt's old car to her sons in Los Angeles. We set out from College Park, Maryland over winter break our senior year with snacks, clothes, CDs and giddy optimism.

We had a camcorder and made a goofy travelogue. ""This is the Alamo,"" I pointed from a street in San Antonio, with a terrible drawl. ""It's across the street from a Ramada Inn."" Then in the next scene we made a diorama of the battle there using beans, lettuce and other bits of our Mexican dinner as stand ins for Davy Crockett and the 200 others who died.

I read ""On the Road"" on that trip and many of our innocent adventures reflected a less complex time. We spent New Year's Eve in New Orleans. I bought a lasso for my brother. We stayed in a wig-wam themed motel. We reenacted the shootout at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona for our video. We arrived at the Grand Canyon in a snow storm, drove across the Hoover Dam back when you could do that, and gambled in Vegas although my reading of ""Fear and Loathing"" inspired only booking a hotel room at the Circus Circus. One of my favorite coffee mugs to this day is one I bought in New Mexico with a drawing of Billy the Kid in a saloon and my last name printed on it.

The whole trip was like 1950s America -- carefree and wholesome but also a manifest destiny of what was possible. I learned it takes very little to make a dream like driving across the country a reality. And I learned that having a partner to share the observations, driving and singing is ideal.

#5: A fish called Drexl (1996)

After graduating from college and just before I moved to Phoenix, Arizona, my next girlfriend, Sinéad, gave me a fighting Japanese beta fish. I named him Drexl, after a character played by Gary Oldman in Tony Scott's 1993 film ""True Romance.""

I was starting a teaching job through the national service program Teach For America and there was a heat wave as I toured the South. I passed a church in Alabama with a sign that read: ""Sinners, you think it's hot out there?""

Because I was moving, I didn't have a choice but to take Drexl with me. I substituted his glass bowl for a large plastic candy container with holes cut into the lid. I sat him next to me on the passenger side.

Everything I owned was packed into my Toyota Camry, my first car. It had a moonroof I fully enjoyed on that drive. I wasn't in a hurry, and reading ""Blue Highways"" -- a nonfiction account of the author's conversations along local roads (the color blue on old maps) -- inspired me to get off the highways and go through small towns. Some you wouldn't know if you were driving through if it didn't have a church. I stopped in McLean, Texas to take in a subdivided, one-room museum devoted to ""devil's rope"" (barbed wire).

I talked and sang to Drexl for the five days it took me to get to Arizona. He was my Wilson volleyball. I brought him into restaurants and sat him on the table (it was too hot for him to stay in the car). Across long, flat, ranch dotted Texas I could see a massive, far off thunderstorm head toward me and when it hit I pulled over and Drexl and I huddled as the storm rocked the car.

Another time, while simultaneously driving and consulting a guidebook for a place to stop and eat, I looked up to see I was about to rear end the car in front of me. I slammed on the breaks, dislodging Drexl's empty glass fishbowl from its position above my head, wedged between pillows and other belongings.

The bowl smashed into the dashboard, breaking into a million shards while Drexl looked on from the seatbelted safety of his temporary bowl. For weeks after, glass slivers all over the steering wheel and console buried themselves in my hands with each touch.

On that trip I learned that driving for days alone has its own rewards and that fish are terrible conversationalists and singing companions. Drexl may have felt the same way. He died in Phoenix, sparing himself the torture of another cross country trip with me.

#6: Downhill racer (1997)

Squawking over the walking-talkies (years before affordable cell phones), I asked my good friend Genna, in her car in front of me, if we could spend a serendipitous day skiing at Arapahoe Basin in Colorado. It was June.

I was driving back East to Cape Cod, Massachusetts to start a new chapter of life, with Sinéad. Once again, I had all my possessions with me, including my skis.

We found a place for Genna to rent gear but it was so warm out we didn't need gloves or ski pants. By the afternoon, when the snow conditions had melted the snow into mash potatoes, we were wearing t-shirts.

I had applied sunscreen, but the double exposure of sun and sun-reflected-off-snow, was stronger than the protection. That evening I began suffering the worst sunburn of my life. When I smiled, cracks formed around my lips and they bled. I was in constant, cursing out loud pain.

I looked like a freakshow by the time we reached Genna's parents' house in Ohio. Her mom took one look at me, smiled in motherly empathy and whisked me to their bathroom where she handed me a large tube of aloe that began the healing.

On that trip I learned that seizing the moment is worth the pain that may follow, that you can never apply too much sunscreen, and that the superhero origin story of my friend Genna's many virtues is rooted in her family.

#7: On the road again (1999)

""Pull over,"" Sinéad said.

We were on a small winding road in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, halfway to San Francisco in a one-way rental to start another chapter out West.

We didn't have jobs or an apartment in The City yet, but coming off a year of living in Ireland and writing a travel guide book together, we had a trunk full of hope and confidence it would all work out. We also had Sinéad's cat, Teasy, who we let roam free around the car. I reread ""On the Road"" on that trip.

Back in beautiful Colorado -- my favorite state to drive across -- I pulled over on the shoulder in time for Sinéad to open the door and puke efficiently, even with a bit of dignity.

When you're in a car for days, you get creative with your photography. You have time. David Allan/CNN

We had spent the night before indulging in local brews during a poorly executed visit to see my ex-girlfriend, Anna (see trip #4), who was staging casino shows near the former gold rush town of Golden.

The next morning Sinéad and I nursed hangovers through breakfast. Then a few miles along the mountainous road, she got sick. ""Must be the altitude,"" she said. I politely agreed.

On that trip I learned cats make better road trip companions than fish and that ""altitude sickness"" is not to be trifled with.

#8: A place called Hope (2000)

A year and half later Sinéad and I had broken up. I was headed to Scotland to write another travel guide on my own, and drown my tears in whisky. Instead of storing my things and flying East, my brother, Matthew, flew out to San Francisco and we rented a car to drive. We had plenty of time, and I had a lot to process.

We also had a cardboard cutout of president Bill Clinton, a prize I'd won at one of the many pointless but fun open bar parties of the first dot com boom that was a perk of living in San Francisco back then.

Matthew and I pulled a ""Weekend at Bernie's"" and took Bill's photo at the Grand Canyon, outside his boyhood home in Hot Springs, in the parking lot of a Piggly Wiggly grocery store, under the St. Lois Arch, and standing next to a fishing bait vending machine in the Ozarks. Sadly, those pictures were lost during one of my many moves, but Matthew, Bill and I will always have the Piggly Wiggly.

The other story we tell from that trip was about some fireworks we bought in New Mexico, but then realized we didn't have a place to shoot them off. Our attempt to try at a random field in Missouri inspired a group of locals blocking our car and their leader asking ""Whatchu boys doin' in our corn field?"" We briefly thought we were going to be killed.

I learned that a cardboard Bill Clinton makes for a better cross-country driving companion than even a fish or a cat, and that you can't just go an' shoot fireworks off in someone's corn field.

#9: Home wet home (2003)

I ended up returning to San Francisco for a couple of more years, falling in love with Kate (now my wife), and we moved to Bangkok together. After a year in Thailand and another spent traveling around the world , and getting engaged, we decided to move to New York.

All our belongings had been in storage in San Francisco while we were abroad so we bought a van to haul it East. It cost $3,000, the same as a one-way van rental. The plan was to sell it after the trip and that's what we did, for $3,000.

We made bright curtains for the van's small windows out of a blue tablecloth with yellow flowers, and bought a $20 tent at the Peace Supply Store in Flagstaff, Arizona to camp on the way. We only used it once.

Somehow we slept for much of the night despite the pounding on the tent and the edges leaking in water. At around dawn we gave in.

I opened the fly to see that a moat of water had surrounded the tent. We threw it and its soaked contents into the van and drove to their recreation center where we had the loveliest morning watching ""The Today Show,"" drinking fresh coffee and drying all our stuff in the laundry room."
http://cnn.com,"With many national parks closed, their animal residents are getting a break (from us)","(CNN) — Yosemite, Yellowstone, Grand Canyon. These are the stars of the United States' national parks system, and with good reason.

Often called ""America's Best Idea,"" the creation of national parks in the United States launched a worldwide movement to protect the Earth's natural treasures.

be very busy during These headliner national parks would typicallybe very busy during National Park Week , going on now through April 26. (The National Park Service welcomed more than 327 million visitors last year, a 2.9% increase from 2018, and the third highest number since record keeping began in 1904.)

But the coronavirus pandemic has shut down many of the most popular national parks, creating a forced experiment: What happens when animals who make their homes in these protected space have (mostly) free rein of the park grounds?

""With Yosemite and other parks closed to tourists, wildlife is coming out of hiding, and indeed, even thriving in our absence, reclaiming some of the places that have been dominated by human activity for decades,"" said Beth Pratt, National Wildlife Federation's regional executive director for California.

""With threats like vehicle collisions or being harassed for a selfie largely eliminated, the coyotes are trotting through Camp Curry hunting mice, and the black bears [are] wandering around a mostly empty Yosemite Village,"" said Pratt, who was vice president/CFO at the nonprofit Yosemite Conservancy for 10 years and still lives near the park.

It shows ""that even in our best protected places on the planet -- our national parks -- wildlife still get impacted by us humans,"" Pratt continued.

""More than 400 bears have been hit by cars in Yosemite since 1995. That the animals seem to be enjoying this vacation from us is a good reminder that when the parks do reopen, let's be kinder and more respectful to the wildlife who call Yosemite and other parks home.""

National parks were created during wartime

This isn't the first time the US government has taken measures to protect nature during a human crisis.

President Abraham Lincoln and Congress protected parts of what is now Yosemite during the throes of the Civil War, with the passage and signing of the Yosemite Land Grant of 1864. It didn't become a national park until 1890.

Yellowstone was the world's first national park, created in 1872, and it wasn't controversial because it was so far away from where many people lived at the time.

Most members of Congress didn't oppose the legislation because they hadn't seen the land, now-retired Yellowstone National Park historian Lee Whittlesey told CNN Travel during a 2016 interview about the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service.

The federal park legislation was just a political answer to a territorial argument. Meant to be a state park, Yellowstone land was in three territories.

""There was an immediate argument between Montana and Wyoming newspapers about who would get the park,"" Whittlesey said. ""That is why Congress made it a federal park.""

Lucky us.

Proof that nature is good for us

There's no doubt that fans of the national parks will want to return to hike, picnic, camp and marvel at the views when they reopen. Nature is good for us, and studies back that up.

In a study released in early April, researchers found children who felt connected to nature -- described as feeling pleasure when hearing nature sounds and seeing animals and wildflowers -- engaged in actions that helped other people. They also recycled, saved water and cared for the environment in other ways.

Adults do better in nature, too. People who take walks in nature report less repetitive negative thoughts, according to a 2015 study.

But we need to take care of our natural treasures -- and it's not just the wildlife humans should be more thoughtful of when parks reopen.

When the federal government shut down from December 22, 2018 to January 25, 2019, the gates to many national parks were left open and irresponsible visitors created lasting damage.

Toilets overflowed, trash piled up and there was damage caused at Joshua Tree National Park , among other national parks, during the shutdown.

To be sure, there's only so much maintenance NPS staff can do to repair the more recent damage. They also face a $12 billion maintenance backlog that money, not just time, will heal.

The parks are for us and future generations

Conservation and current enjoyment of the parks, as stated in the 1916 legislation establishing the creation of the park service, should be ""in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.""

The creators of the park service wanted us, as those future generations, to be caretakers -- not exploiters -- of our protected national resources.

It's possible that the closed parks will reopen before parks and their surrounding communities -- which often have limited medical facilities -- have time to hire their seasonal workers, said Phil Francis, chair of the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks.

""Visitors should consider that if they go to a popular park soon after reopening, they could find very crowded conditions.""

""The NPS will certainly appreciate visitors who obey park rules and regulations,"" Francis said. ""If restrooms are closed, please compensate for that before you arrive. Consider public hygiene. ""

""Take out the trash you generate -- pack it in, pack it out -- and follow leave no trace principles,"" he said. ""If garbage cans are full, take it with you and do not leave your trash beside overflowing garbage cans.

""Visitors can help by not trashing the park or damaging park facilities and resources.""

Writer and historian Wallace Stegner called America' national parks ""the best idea we ever had. Absolutely American, absolutely democratic, they reflect us at our best rather than our worst.""

Let's bring our best selves when we return to visit these national treasures.

http://cnn.com,What happened when I bought a hotel by mistake,"(CNN) — Anyone currently whiling away the long hours of lockdown with when-this-is-all-over dreams of a fresh start in life, should heed this as a cautionary tale.

In 2011, at the age of 44, I had my own mid-life-crisis career swerve, ditching journalism to start a new life as the owner of a waterfront hotel, restaurant and bar on the Scottish island of Islay.

Four months later, having already developed a slightly queasy sense that I might have made a mistake, confirmation that I wasn't cut out for the hospitality trade duly arrived over breakfast in the hotel dining room, one November Sunday morning.

Achingly hungover and struggling to force some restorative porridge down, I was trying to avoid the glare of low winter sun reflecting off the loch while keeping one heavy-lidded eye on events unfolding at a nearby table.

An American guest had brusquely refused to take delivery of one lot of eggs, quite rightly given they'd been poached to the point she could have bounced them back to the kitchen on their own.

Judging by the sunglasses she was wearing, the woman was also dealing with the consequences of an evening spent in the company of the local water of life.

An offended waitress was avoiding her eye and I could see the color in the customer's cheeks evolving from slightly flushed to incandescent puce as the minutes ticked by with no sign of a replacement breakfast arriving.

""Bloody kitchen,"" I thought, not for the first time.

Low expectations

The hotel bar was jumping ... at first. James Deane Photography

Had I really had a vocation for my new profession, I guess I'd have got up at that point, apologized to the customer and barged into the kitchen to deliver a sweary lecture on the advantages of a simmering over a rolling boil, in the manner of Gordon Ramsay.

I'd then have triumphantly emerged with ""eggs to die for"" and a grovelling display of obsequiousness.

In real life, I slouched lower in my chair and wished I wasn't watching a surreal black comedy playing out in an uncomfortably familiar set.

One of the good/bad things about running a restaurant in Scotland is that hardly anyone ever complains, far less send food back.

Even if customers have thought something was completely underwhelming, they invariably respond to, ""How was that?"" with some variation of ""Fine, thanks!""

I think this is explained by the fact that overseas visitors to our shores frequently start with low expectations while, among those from the rest of Britain, there's a hard-wired politeness that short-circuits complaints.

I appreciate the desire not to offend, but recognize that it doesn't do anything to help address the much-improved but still uneven standards that lead to the low expectations.

This reluctance of the audience to criticize or complain also tends to breed complacency in the performers, with the result that even the mildest expression of less than total satisfaction can elicit a prickly reaction.

'You should be ashamed ...'

Angus MacKinnon: ""I wasn't cut out for the hospitality trade."" Tissy Northcote

So it was that my more-prickly-than-most breakfast chef reacted to the snubbing of the first lot of eggs by simmering in silent rage for 20 minutes before sending out a replacement plate with two eggs so lightly poached the yolk looked like it was enveloped in an extra-gossamer condom.

Not entirely unexpectedly, the now nauseous recipient, a 30-something from Chicago, flipped her lid, shoved the plate back in the direction of a soon-to-be weeping waitress and fled upstairs in a cloud of Windy City expletives.

Bad as this was, I felt confident that, armed with my growing experience of dealing with complaints, I'd be able to limit the damage when the woman came to check out.

""I saw what happened, I'm so, so sorry and .... ,"" I started to say.

""Damn right you should be sorry ... "" she interrupted.

Angus MacKinnon “The TripAdvisor review that popped up in my inbox a few days later was remarkably balanced in the circumstances. Which only made it worse of course. ”

""Yes, well, as I said, really sorry and ... ""

""Sorry? Should be ashamed of this crap ...""

""Well, perhaps not the only one who should be ashamed, eh? Anyway, sorry again ...""

""What did you say? I can't believe this. Like. I'm in the wrong here?""

""As I was saying, I've taken breakfast off the ...""

""I'm not paying a cent for this ... ""

At which point something snapped in the customer-is-always-right part of my dehydrated brain. Before I knew it, I'd embarked on a sermon on the theme of ""You people, coming in here, thinking you can talk to my staff like that. Who do you think you are ...""

By the end I'd got myself so worked up with righteous indignation I had no alternative but to go for a dramatic concluding flourish.

""Do you know what, just go,"" I said as I ripped the bill for a three-night stay up in front of her.

The TripAdvisor review that popped up in my inbox a few days later was remarkably balanced in the circumstances.

Which only made it worse, of course.

Moments of clarity

Business owners like to moan about inaccurate, even malicious, posts on review platforms, but my experience on that side of the fence was that reviewers, on the whole, try to give an honest account of their experience. In my case they probably had a tendency to be slightly too generous.

I was to have another two ""moments of clarity"" about my future as a hotelier in the months after Eggs-gate.

One was a bare knuckle fight with an outside generator at 4 a.m. on the night a hurricane struck the island. The other was the realization that a five-figure amount had evaporated from the business in the first six months of my dilettante stewardship.

""You were kind of asking for it,"" the local police sergeant told me as he closed the unsolved case with an unforgiving review of my arrangements for shepherding cash on its journey from tills to safe to bank.

Angus MacKinnon “Looking back, nine years later, my naivety about almost every aspect of my ill-judged venture seems scarcely comprehensible now.”

Looking back, nine years later, my naivety about almost every aspect of my ill-judged venture seems scarcely comprehensible now.

It wasn't like I wasn't advised against the whole business.

When I asked a longstanding hotelier on the island, then in the process of selling up, if he had any tips for a younger man starting out, he replied: ""Don't do it."" When I laughed he added: ""I'm not joking.""

Then there was the friend from school days who had bluntly told me, ""you're completely unsuited for it."" All of which only made me more determined to dive in with fingers in both ears.

Despite having a large amount of capital to invest and the security of a solid building, most banks weren't interested in giving me a mortgage because their loan criteria for the sector explicitly requires applicants to have two years experience in the business.

That should have set alarm bells ringing but my reaction was more akin to ""Don't these people know who I am?""

""I've run a newsroom covering half the planet! I've worked on really complex business stories. I've filed copy on the whistle at World Cup finals,"" I'd fume to myself. ""How hard can it be to change a beer barrel?""

While there's some truth in that, it is not really the point.

'A really nice house party'

Islay is part of the Inner Hebrides islands off Scotland's west coast. Angus MacKinnon

The high failure rate of wannabe Conrad Hiltons has taught lenders to restrict access to their funds to those with solid experience in the trade. Only they go into it with their eyes fully open to the realities of being tied to a business 365/7, and the draining relentlessness of its ""finish late, start early"" rhythms.

I told myself I'd considered all that, that journalism had inured me to long hours. But mostly I just avoided dwelling on the inconvenient truths of the trade: Instead, my mind's eye was swamped with visions of making over the rooms in subtle shades, revamping the wine list and collecting langoustines from boats at dawn.

I did do some of those things and, for a while, my partner and I had the place jumping to the rhythm of two dinner sittings a night and the sound of a packed bar.

During that brief, exhilarating time it was easy to understand why having your own hotel appeals to so many journalists and others from creative professions.

Angus MacKinnon “Fortunately, it turned out that putting my head in the sand, or under the duvet more precisely, wasn't such a disastrous thing to do. ”

For reporters who have lived itinerant lives constantly on deadline, the idea of settling down in one place and a less pressured, slower existence can become overwhelmingly alluring at a certain stage of life -- particularly if you can imagine it as retaining some of the excitement and camaraderie that goes with the territory in journalism.

I remember a colleague who approved of my nutty plan telling me: ""Yeah, I've always thought it'd be great to have a hotel by the sea. It'd be just like having a really nice house party.""

Plenty of interesting people came to my hotel. I liked meeting them and having a drink with them. The wine list did get better.

But the high summer honeymoon soon give way to an autumnal realization that the list of skills required to really make the business work was topped by secretarial and bookkeeping efficiency, home improvement handiness and a nose for where to source the cheapest toilet paper.

Heart attack fears

MacKinnon: ""I knew if it went bust I could lose a huge chunk of savings."" Tissy Northcote

I wasn't only not very good at any of those, I was practically allergic to chores I regarded as drudgery. Pretty soon I was so depressed about the enormity of the mistake I'd made I could barely bear to think about it, far less do anything to extract myself from my folly.

To make things worse, in my zeal to get into the business I'd mortgaged the house I'd built on the island to clinch my hard-won loan. I couldn't face running the hotel but I knew if it went bust I could lose a huge chunk of 25 years worth of work and savings.

Of that winter I remember almost nothing but the intense stress that twice sent me to doctors convinced the pounding in my chest and head would inevitably trigger a heart attack or a stroke.

Most nights were spent with the BBC World Service rumbling all night on the bedside, Syria's implosion compounding my sleepless gloom. Every day had to start with a long calming walk which enabled me to function, but not to the point of dealing with the millstone now hanging round my neck.

Fortunately, it turned out that putting my head in the sand, or under the duvet more precisely, wasn't such a disastrous thing to do. The business I'd bought was essentially solid, the island's tourist economy was strong and growing and my employees could be relied on to keep things ticking over on a breakeven, pay the mortgage basis.

Eventually a far more agile pair of hands arrived with a proposal to lease the business from me. That worked well enough that a few years later he was able to buy me out.

I'd managed to escape my own dream without any financial scars. ""Well, at least you gave it a go,"" my lawyer said. ""You'd have regretted it if you hadn't!""

So would I do it all again?"
http://cnn.com,Intermittent fasting and a new passion helped him lose 95 pounds,"(CNN) In May 2018, Jared Sklar's wake-up call was waiting for him when he got home from work. He opened the fridge and saw four different pizza boxes from four different restaurants.

""It's pretty embarrassing, but it's the truth,"" Sklar said. ""I just opened the door, and I was just like, 'What are we doing here?' ""

At 285 pounds (129 kilograms), he would sit on the couch and watch TV, with no energy left after conquering the work day. Late-night snacks included popcorn and ice cream. The 27-year-old, who works in sales for Corporate Strategies in Woodland Hills, California, knew something had to change.

And gradually, his clothes felt like they were getting smaller every time he did laundry.

""It gets to that point where you realize that you're getting bigger; the clothes aren't getting smaller,"" he said. ""It was that a-ha moment.""

There were other epiphanies as well. Sklar missed the feeling he got when he used to play sports as a teenager. And there was a history of heart disease in his family.

Together, he and his girlfriend, Samatha MacDonald, decided to make a lifestyle change. They had talked about doing it before, but this time, it stuck. They didn't want to look back 20 years from now and realize they could have made changes to be healthier then.

Jared and his girlfriend, Samantha, during their lifestyle change.

First, they would start going to the gym. But they didn't want to put in the hours of fitness without having the right diet to fuel it and bring up their energy levels.

Other diets sounded too quick for what Sklar wanted to do. He researched intermittent fasting and decided to try it as a sustainable long-term option.

Sklar and MacDonald would eat their meals between 12 p.m. and 8 p.m. each day, creating a 16-hour break before eating again. This helped them kick the late-night snacking habit.

""I like time restricted feeding because it allows you to naturally reduce your food intake without counting calories,"" said Lisa Drayer, CNN contributor and registered dietician. ""You eliminate mindless nibbling in the evening and you're also eating in sync with your circadian rhythm so you're front loading your calories, which is more favorable for weight loss.""

They immediately noticed their energy levels start to pick back up as they swapped out pizza for proteins like turkey alongside vegetables, spaghetti squash instead of spaghetti and Greek yogurt bars instead of ice cream.

""When you're eating only during an eight-hour period, you do want to follow good nutritional guidelines, including protein, fiber, enough fluids in your diet as well,"" Drayer said.

Sklar loved eating healthier options, but sometimes had a hard time getting up to go to the gym. For MacDonald, food was a weakness, but she was excited to get up and work out.

""We pushed each in our weak areas,"" MacDonald said. ""We were on different pages initially but pushed each other to be on the same page, and that was a huge help.""

Sklar was also dealing with a chronic hamstring issue, discovered by his doctor after playing flag football and repeatedly pulling his hamstring before the diet. His doctor recommended low-impact exercise, which led Sklar to try indoor cycling. He went to the gym six days a week and pedaled for 45 minutes each day.

The couple tried working out together, but found they slowed each other down. While Sklar was pedaling at the gym, MacDonald found that working out at a high-intensity interval training studio worked better for her.

Sklar and MacDonald also cut back on carbohydrates and replaced a lot of the red meat in his diet with leaner proteins like fish, chicken or ground turkey. They became more conscious of what they were eating overall, making healthier decisions during their eight-hour window each day.

""If you're only eating in these eight hours, it's powerful to choose what you put into your body,"" MacDonald said.

The first month, he had lost 15 pounds (6.8 kilograms) while cycling and starting intermittent fasting. It continued for the next six months. Sklar fell in love with cycling. The combination of the music and the calories burned during each session fueled him to continue.

Sklar also found motivation when a close family member had to undergo triple bypass surgery in October.

""When you see that person in the hospital going through that, you just think to yourself that you never want that to happen to you, and you want to prevent it from happening to anybody else that you know,"" Sklar said. ""That was my why. That was a light bulb moment where I knew I had to not only keep this going, lose the weight for me, but I also needed to keep it going for my future self and everybody else around me.""

Over a six to seven-month period, Sklar lost 95 pounds (43 kg). Eventually, one of the instructors pulled Sklar aside and told him he should start teaching an indoor cycling class. He's been teaching for about six months now.

For MacDonald, the changes have been more mental than physical. She lost 12 pounds (5.4 kilograms) and loves feeling stronger.

""On a busy day, the hour I'm going to the gym is something I'm giving myself,"" she said.

When you realize you're gaining more muscle and feeling better every day, you can feel yourself getting stronger. That was a big thing. I had never stayed with a workout long enough to feel those changes after months. It makes me feel better every day to slowly see these changes in my body.""

In the morning, Sklar usually has a glass of water after getting up. Lunch is at noon, followed by snacks throughout the day. Before a workout, Sklar enjoys peanut butter and jelly on a rice cake.

""I teach a spin class at 5:30 at night, then I'll have a protein shake and dinner right after, and then I'll maybe have a small snack at 8:00 p.m. I fast for the rest of the night until noon the next day.""

After the initial weight loss, Sklar and MacDonald are allowing for a little more flexibility if they have a special event. But they are committed to being as healthy and fit as possible for the long-term. Intermittent fasting helped them form healthy habits.

Sklar is also training for a triathlon now.

Sklar is much more energetic and confident after his weight loss.

""There's always something in front of me to keep me motivated, to make sure that I don't fall back into my old habits,"" Sklar said.

Sklar is continuing to fast and maintain an active lifestyle. He's more confident , energetic and positive. Sometimes, old friends and coworkers don't recognize him. As his story spreads, Sklar has been able to reconnect with friends or acquaintances and share advice on weight loss and fitness. Sklar didn't realize how much it would mean to him.

""I found that in the long run, I was doing it for my friends, as well, because they found inspiration from it,"" Sklar said.

Being able to make this lifestyle change with his girlfriend has made all the difference, Sklar said.

""It was hugely beneficial to have a support system with me,"" Sklar said. ""There's always going to be those days where you want to cheat and have a pizza, and just having a support system to keep you in check and being responsible for keeping somebody else in check was really important, to me."""
http://cnn.com,More than pho: 5 dishes every Hanoi visitor needs to try,"Hanoi (CNN) — When former President Barack Obama traveled to Hanoi in 2016, he famously joined the late Anthony Bourdain for a meal of bun cha, a beloved local specialty made up of bits of marinated, charcoal-grilled pork patties and pork slices in a dipping sauce with rice noodles and herb garnishes.

And then of course there's the world-famous pho. Made with rice noodles, this beef noodle soup is a must-try on the streets of Hanoi -- not to mention readily available overseas.

But there's much more to the city's diverse food scene.

Here are five dishes every Hanoi visitor -- not just global leaders -- should try. (And yes, we know, we've barely scratched the surface. For more amazing meals, check out our list of 40 delicious Vietnamese foods .)

Cha Ca (fish cooked with turmeric and dill)

Hanoians consider cha ca to be so exceptional that there is a road in the capital dedicated to these fried morsels of fish -- Cha Ca Street.

Along the busy road, where spiderwebs of exposed electric wires hang overhead, dozens of specialists compete to sell the best cha ca -- crispy turmeric-marinated fish that's fried tableside in a pan with herbs.

The most famous restaurant on this strip is Ca La Vong -- one of the oldest eateries in Hanoi -- and the first to set up shop on Cha Ca Street, over a century ago.

The dish itself dates back more than 130 years. It was first invented by the local Doan family, who served the special meal to troops during French colonial rule.

Banh Tom (shrimp cake)

For Hanoi's best fish cakes, head to Thanh Nien Street. Christina Choi/CNN

Deceptively time-intensive, Hanoi-style banh tom, or shrimp cakes, have just a few main ingredients: freshwater crayfish or shrimp from West Lake, flour and sweet potato.

Instead of grinding the shrimp into a paste (like a fish ball), the fried seafood is usually left whole -- sitting atop the crunchy cakes.

It's typically served with lettuce leaves for wrapping, plus chili, lime juice and fish sauce for dipping.

Banh tom is thought to have become common in the 1930s when small street vendors began congregating along Thanh Nien Street -- a road that separates West Lake (Tây Hồ) and Trúc Bạch Lake.

When the hawkers garnered popularity, the government later combined many of the stalls and opened one big restaurant along the waterfront.

Enter Banh Tom Ho Tay . Today, the restaurant remains a fixture on Thanh Nien Street and still draws a steady stream of friends and families, gathering for slow afternoons full of crispy, savory shrimp cakes, chilled bia hoi (local draft beer), and front-row seats to the lake.

Bun Ca (fish noodle soup)

Fresh and light, bun ca combines fried fishcakes, dill, tomatoes, green onions, and perilla -- a mint-like herb.

A lunchtime staple in Hanoi, you can find bun ca (fish noodle soup) just about anywhere.

But Mark Lowerson, founder of Hanoi Street Tours, points to a vendor west of the Old Quarter called Van, that specializes in the dish.

""This is one of the best in town,"" he tells CNN Travel. ""There are two types of noodles, and then your choice of steamed or fried fish.""

While in other countries, adding salt could be considered an insult to the chef -- Lowerson says that's not the case in Vietnam.

""Here, you are expected to use the condiments on the table,"" he explains.

""Add a little lime, vinegar, chili and herbs to achieve the essential balance of salty, sour, sweet and spicy.""

Bun Rieu Cua (crab noodle soup)

Crabmeat is the star of Bún riêu -- a meat or seafood vermicelli soup. Dan Tham

Bun rieu is a meat or seafood vermicelli soup with a distinctive crimson color. The broth gets its appearance from tomato paste and annatto oil, made from achiote tree seeds.

Freshwater crabmeat and blanched tomatoes are the soup's star players. Tamarind paste lends sourness to the broth, while airy bits of fried tofu contribute crunch.

Depending on the region, bun rieu might also come topped with beef, pork, snails or fish.

Vermicelli noodles swim in the soup, adding balance to a dish that's both colorful and light. Add to that the requisite plateful of lime wedges, chili and greens -- like banana blossoms and mint -- and you have a perfect meal.

Where to try it? There's an excellent bun rieu street stall run by Ms. Thu, located in Thọ Xương Alley, near St. Joseph's Cathedral.

Ca Phe Trung (egg coffee)

Would you like some eggs with your coffee? In Hanoi, ca phe trung -- or egg coffee -- is a local favorite.

Vietnamese ""egg coffee"" -- or Ca Phe Trung -- is a Hanoi specialty in which a creamy soft, meringue-like egg white foam is perched on dense Vietnamese coffee.

While destinations across the city now serve it, Hanoi's humble Cafe Giang cafe claims to have invented it.

There are hot and cold versions. The former is served as a yellow concoction in a small glass. It's consumed with a spoon and tastes almost like a coffee flavored ice cream -- more like a dessert than coffee.

The hot version comes resting in a small dish of hot water to maintain its temperature. The strong coffee taste at the bottom of the cup seeps through the egg -- the yellow layer on top -- and is quite thick and sweet, though not sickly."
http://cnn.com,Tohoku: A Japan destination for all seasons,"Editor's Note — CNN Travel's series often carry sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy

(CNN) — Let's face the facts. Japan is a popular place.

With close to 30 million international travelers heading there in 2018, tourists visiting traditional hotspots such as Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka during peak travel periods -- say, cherry blossom season in the spring -- will find themselves battling overwhelming crowds.

But the northern region of Tohoku remains surprisingly undertraveled in comparison, making it a fantastic destination any time of year.

Located at the tip of Japan's main island of Honshu, Tohoku is made up of six prefectures: Aomori, Akita, Fukushima, Iwate, Miyagi and Yamagata, all of which are filled with dramatic landscapes, historical attractions and culinary delights.

Here's a sample of some of the top Tohoku experiences on offer. For even more ideas, click through the above gallery.

Zao Onsen, where snow monsters roar

As winter storms rush though Japan's Zao Mountain Range, trees are transformed into incredible ""snow monsters.""

The Tohoku region gets some of the world's biggest dumps of snowfall each winter, making it a great alternative to traditional ski resort destinations such as the wildly popular Hokkaido to the north.

One of the most foreigner-friendly destinations in the area, Zao Onsen in Yamagata prefecture is well-equipped to welcome powder hunters looking for some time on the slopes.

But the real reason to visit is to see Japan's famed snow monsters -- or ""juhyo"" in Japanese.

Every winter, as Siberian winds rush though the Zao Mountain Range, trees begin to collect thick, juicy layers of snow and ice. The trees freeze into fascinating humanesque forms.

To access the snow monsters, head for the Zao Onsen Ski Resort , which is spread over several peaks.

It's a mid-sized facility that's ideal for beginner and intermediate skiers and snowboarders. Zao's longest downhill course is a 10-kilometer stretch that starts up at the snow monster observation area.

l e v a r t

The best time to see the monsters is late January to early March, before the spring warmth seeps in.

If you can't make it in winter, there's still plenty to see. For instance, the gorgeous Okama Crater Lake is surrounded by the three peaks of Tohoku's Zao mountain range.

It was named after ""kama,"" a traditional iron pot that shares its shape, and can be visited in the summer months.

Akita, birthplace of Japan's most beloved dog breed

Employed as everything from mascots and resort greeters to train station masters, Japan's adorable Akita Inu dogs -- which originally come from Tohoku's Akita prefecture -- have been charming the nation for decades.

The most famous Akita is Hachito, who was immortalized in film and has his own statue In Shibuya, Tokyo.

According to the legend, Hachito visited Shibuya station every single evening for a year to greet his caretaker after work. Sadly, one day his human friend died while on the job and did not return. Nevertheless, Hachito continued to visit the same spot every day for nine years.

How's that for loyalty?

More recently, a band of Akita dogs was employed by a regional tourism body to create what might just be the strangest pop music video we've ever seen. (Check it out below.)

Want to meet some of these canine cuties in person? Head for Odate, Akita's capital.

The Akita Dog Visitor Center at Odate Station is home to two honorary station masters, while the Akita Dog Museum offers a look at the history of these cute canines.

Wanko soba: An all-you-can-eat noodle binge

At the Azumaya Soba Shop in Morioka, brave eaters can eat as many bowls of soba as they want for 3,240 yen (or $31.80). It's also known as Japan's Wanko Soba Noodle Challenge.

Only for the hungry, the wanko soba challenge is an all-you-can-eat buckwheat noodle binge unique to Japan's Iwate prefecture.

Here's how it goes: A server brings tiny bowls of noodles, laying them down one after another as quick as you can slurp them back.

As soon as you empty a bowl, she'll swoop in to fill it with another mouthful, yelling ""hai dan dan!""

There's only one way to ebb the noodle flow -- put a lid your wanko (bowl).

Related content The ultimate all-you-can-eat noodle binge

There are a few rules involved.

For starters, you have to eat continuously. You can't take a break and digest your noodles then come back to the table for more.

We recommend trying it at the Azumaya Soba Shop in Morioka, Iwate's capital.

There are four Morioka locations but the Ekimae branch is just a two-minute walk from the train station and has English-language menus.

Matsushima: Japan's most scenic views

l e v a r t

Matsushima is one of the fabled ""Nihon Sankei"" -- or ""Three Views of Japan.""

More than 260 tiny, pine tree-covered islands dot the waters of Matsushima Bay, creating a scene that's been the muse of dozens of Japanese poets and artists through the ages.

To truly appreciate Matsushima's beauty, head straight for the shore near the Matsushima Kaigan train station. Several islands are connected to the mainland by photo-worthy red bridges, such as the exquisite Fukuurabashi Bridge, which leads to Fukuurajima Island.

Home to more than 300 species of flowers, plants and trees, the island's network of walking paths leads to several viewpoints.

Nearby, the beautiful Godaido Temple, founded in 807, sits on another small island that's also connected to the mainland via a series of red bridges.

To explore further afield, cruises depart from Matsushima Pier every hour. The 50-minute tour takes travelers around the bay, passing islands and oyster farms.

Doesn't hurt that the food's amazing in Matsushima, too.

""Seafood in the Matsushima area is considered of the highest quality because the seafood harvested in the area benefits from the nutrient-rich water and plankton found off its coast,"" says award-winning author Hiroko Shimbo, an expert on Japanese cuisine who organizes culinary tours through the country.

""In addition to oysters there are such local specialties as salmon, skipjack tuna (katsuo), Pacific pike (sanma), northern clam (hokkigai), asari clams, abalone (awabi), scallops (hotategai) and the best-quality wakame (sea vegetable) -- don't call it seaweed!""

The small but substantial Matsushima Fish Market is a fine place to kick off a culinary tour of the town.

Vendors here serve everything from ramen and sushi to oyster croquette burgers.

Sendai: Japan's beef tongue capital

l e v a r t

Though gyutan -- beef tongue -- is available at yakiniku restaurants all over Japan, Sendai is where you'll find the highest concentration of eateries solely dedicated to grilling up these juicy strips of meat.

The original beef tongue restaurant is Aji Tasuke, founded in 1948 by a man named Keishiro Sano.

He left Sendai to apprentice in Tokyo around 1935. It was there that he met a French chef, who he saw cooking up a beef tongue stew. Inspired, he decided to prepare it differently to suit Japanese tastes.

After World War II ended, he returned north and opened a restaurant in Sendai. Due to food shortages, he began serving his take on beef tongue, along with tail soup.

Seven decades on, Sano's photo still hangs on the wall and the restaurant is still going strong, now run by his eldest son.

And it's got competition. Nowadays you can't turn a corner in the center of this city of one million people without seeing a restaurant advertising gyutan -- ""gyu"" is Japanese for cow, while the ""tan"" refers to the English word for tongue.

Yamadera, one of Japan's most beautiful temples

Those willing to climb the site's 1,015 stairs are rewarded with great views — and maybe even a bit of luck.

You're going to have to work a bit to enjoy this one.

The stunning Yamadera Risshakuji Temple complex is located on Mount Hoju-san in Japan's Yamagata prefecture. But here's the kicker: You have to walk up 1,015 stairs to reach it.

Though its official name is Risshakuji, locals refer to it simply as Yamadera -- which means ""mountain temple.""

The temple complex, founded in AD 860 to oversee the northern Tohoku region's Tendai Buddhism sect, is actually made up of more than a dozen sites of religious importance, such as shrines, gates and monuments.

Climbing the staircase is intended to be a meditative experience and is said to bring good luck to those who reach the top.

Like many of Japan's attractions, this one is beautiful no matter the season but we recommend going in fall or winter, when the views of the Yamagata countryside are particularly spectacular.

Getting there is easy. Yamadera Station is about a 40-minute train ride from Tohoku's biggest city, Sendai, in neighboring Miyagi prefecture.

When it comes to traditional arts, Tohoku is where you'll find some of the country's most impressive ancient crafts -- still being produced by skilled artists to this day.

There's magewappa, or bent woodware, a traditional craft that originated in Akita and is used to make bento boxes, steamers and other items.

Meanwhile artisans in Aizu, Fukushima prefecture's westernmost region, have been making erosoku -- large colored candles -- by hand for hundreds of years.

But the most popular Tohoku souvenir of them all has to be kokeshi -- traditional wooden dolls.

The wooden dolls are believed to have first been made during the Edo period (1603 to 1868) in an onsen area in Tohoku's Miyagi prefecture.

The sweet smell of sugar, egg and custard, baking til it's cooked just right. Flaky pastry on the outside, soft custard on the inside, and crispy, burnt, sugar on top.

It's the signature smell of Margaret's Café e Nata -- one of the most popular places to eat in Macao, a former Portuguese colony.

The cafe is especially famous for one thing: the Macanese egg tart. It's a sweet pastry inspired by its Portuguese and Chinese counterparts, made fresh daily by owner Margaret Wong.

If visitors aren't there for a treat from the bakery, chances are they're there to see Wong.

After three decades in the food business, she's a colorful personality who still spends every day working hard at the cafe. She can be spotted working the cash register or bustling about in the kitchen.

Few people know Macanese egg tarts better than Wong, who began making the dish 30 years ago with her late ex-husband Andrew Stow.

The couple founded their first bakery business, Lord Stow's, in 1989. Today, Lord Stow's is run by their daughter Audrey and Andrew's sister Eileen.

Margaret's Café e Nata, which she subsequently founded in 1992, is entirely run by Wong herself.

Some online reports suggest that Wong founded her cafe to compete with Lord Stow's -- which netizens claim was born as a result of a domestic feud following the couple's divorce.

She wouldn't comment on the rumors, though she spoke openly about the early days of their romance.

""We were married three times -- once in Hong Kong, once in England and once in a church,"" she says.

According to Wong, the couple met in a local church, where she played the organ.

""One day my foster mother was visiting from America, and we bumped into Andrew, who gave me a hug and a kiss and I went all red. He was friends with everybody so I didn't think I was anything special ... but my mother said 'Margaret, I think this is the right one for you.'""

The two were married in 1988.

Up to 10,000 tarts a day

Together, the couple created their signature egg tart dish, which is now an iconic Macao dish. Purists argue this egg tart tastes nothing like its Portuguese or Chinese counterparts.

According to Wong, that's the point.

""When we started our bakery, someone asked Andrew to make a pasteis de nata, because they were very popular in Portugal. The first tray came out burnt and wrong, and Andrew wanted to throw them away. I said, hold on, they're edible, so let people just try them. They tried one, and then two, and by the third I said, 'I have to charge you because clearly, it's good!' ""

It's this same recipe, three decades later, that continues to be sold across Macao.

Today, hundreds of tourists and locals alike line up at her cafe for a bite of this now famous pastry.

Wong's cafe alone can make up to 10,000 tarts a day -- all of which are bound to sell out.

""Sometimes people walk in and say -- can I have just one egg tart -- and I say, not even one bite.""

'Like the tart, I never change'

Visitors to Margaret's Café e Nata will usually find her in the kitchen or behind the till. CNN

Every single dish sold by the bakery is graced with Wong's magic touch. In addition to egg tarts, other items on the menu include brownies, cakes and croissants. There's also a salad and sandwich bar.

Despite long working hours, and the physically demanding nature of her work, she still spends almost every day bouncing back and forth between the kitchen and the shop.

""Some of my staff have been working with me for 15 years, they know everything, but still sometimes I have to make sure everything is good -- I'm the boss!"" she says.

She's the boss, but she's also a local celebrity. During our interview Wong is regularly interrupted by friends and fans dropping by to wish her well.

""I open the shop at 8:30 a.m., and I'm here until we close at 4:30 p.m., and I have an hour for lunch. My friend's say I'm crazy... and I'm exhausted,"" she says with a laugh. ""I say I'm getting old, that's why.""

Clearly young at heart, Wong abruptly cuts our interview short, informing us she needs to head to a rock 'n' roll dance class -- but leaves us with a taste of wisdom.

""These days, teenagers, they always want to change their jobs. But for us, we never change. Like the tart, I never change my recipe, I don't want to."""
http://cnn.com,"7 reasons to visit Hoi An, one of Vietnam's most beautiful towns","(CNN) — Set on the banks of the Thu Bon River in central Vietnam , Hoi An is easily one of the most beautiful towns in Southeast Asia.

The action revolves around the atmospheric Old Town -- a colonial-era trade port that was added to UNESCO's World Heritage list in 1999 -- where dreamy canals, French-colonial merchant houses, Japanese bridges, Chinese shophouses and low-key restaurants vie for your attention.

In the quarter's slow-paced laneways, foliage tumbles from shophouse rooftops and residents pedal by on bicycles, unfazed by the heat. Come evening, rows and rows of silk lanterns glow against the inky sky.

And with a few more high-profile international hotels in the works, including the upcoming Alila Hoi An in 2020 and Rosewood Hoi An in 2021, the historic town of just 120,000 people is firmly on every savvy traveler's radar.

Here are seven great reasons to pack your bags and travel to Hoi An:

A whole lotta history

Once a major player in the coveted spice trade, Hoi An served as a busy Asian trading port between the 16th and 19th centuries.

The city attracted merchants from Japan, China, Portugal and France, and the resulting cultural milieu remains visible in everything from the mustard-colored shophouses to dining traditions, folk crafts and robust coffee culture.

You can feel it at the major landmarks, too. On the western end of Old Town, narrow pedestrian streets give way to an 18th-century Japanese covered bridge while ancient ancestral homes, such as the Tan Ky House, mix together Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese architectural traditions.

Delicious food

Hoi An is the banh mi capital of Vietnam. Kate Springer/CNN

Hoi An is commonly considered one of Vietnam's best destinations for food lovers and it delivers on the hype.

You'll devour every kind of food experience here -- graze street food snacks from roadside vendors, slurp noodles on plastic stools, enjoy fresh seafood by the beach or shell out for a splurge.

You'll find a kaleidoscope of tropical fruits and street food at the Central Market, while local signatures like white rose dumplings (made of shrimp or pork with shallots wrapped in translucent rice paper) and crispy cao lầu (a noodle dish starring pork belly and rice crackers) make appearances on most local restaurant menus.

Lest we forget the cultural mash-up that is the banh mi. Some of the city's best banh mi -- stuffed with pate, barbecued pork, chili sauce and vegetables wrapped inside crispy baguettes -- can be found in Old Town at spots like Madame Phuong or Madam Khanh the Banh Mi Queen

There are few chain restaurants in sight. Instead, family-run cafes and restaurants are the norm -- most of which have open-air balconies and no-frills furniture.

Worthwhile souvenirs

Let's just say you might want to bring an empty suitcase.

There are high-quality souvenirs tempting you at every corner, from silk tailoring shops and custom leatherware workshops to coffee roasters, handmade ceramics stalls, beautiful bamboo lantern makers and contemporary home decor boutiques.

There's nothing kitschy about these goods -- in fact, you might treasure a suit tailored in Hoi An or a leather carryall for years to come.

When it comes to tailoring, shops such as Sam Ao Dai , Hung An Cloth Shop (653 Hai Ba Trung) or Sewing Bee Tailors can turn around an order the next day. But if you're not in a hurry, we'd suggest allowing time for alterations.

For a more couture experience, Yaly Couture and A Dong Silk specialize in bespoke, luxurious apparel that would be appropriate for everything from boardrooms to ballrooms.

Another area where Hoi An's contemporary designers shine is homeware accessories.

The light and airy Sunday in Hoi An boutique, for instance, is full of beautiful hand-painted tiles, bamboo furniture, eco-friendly apparel, bedding and bath accessories.

Beautiful beaches

Hoi An is more of a river town than a beach getaway, but sunseekers can easily reach the coastline.

About a 10-minute drive northeast, travelers will find themselves overlooking the East Sea with sweeps of sand running for miles in both directions.

My Khe might be the most famous strip, but An Bang Beach is the most beautiful. Along this tranquil and largely undeveloped shoreline, it's all about low-key beach shacks, chilled beer and live music.

Another safe bet are the beaches around the Son Tra Peninsula, a nature reserve about 25 minutes north by car, where the water's clean and clear.

A biker's paradise

Whether you prefer to pedal around on a bicycle or zip off on a Vespa, Hoi An's wide open country roads are ideal for exploring on two wheels.

The city just launched a new bike-sharing program in June and most hotels offer bike rentals.

It's easy to gently cruise through Old Town, or you can cycle over to Cam Nam Village, the island just to the south across the river, for a peek at rural life.

For countryside tours, Vespa Adventures is your best option.

On the back of a restored 1960s-era Italian scooter, these half-day excursions take travelers across Thu Bon River on a local boat, over a rickety bamboo bridge, across gleaming green rice paddy fields where water buffalo soak up the sun.

World-class hotels

Often jumbled into a two-for-one vacation, Hoi An and nearby Da Nang -- just 15 minutes up the coastline -- play host to some of Vietnam's most alluring hotels.

Brought to life by prolific resort designer Bill Bensley, the contemporary oasis spills across the hills of the Son Tra Peninsula, a nature reserve that's home to rare red-shanked douc monkeys and pangolins.

Then there's Four Seasons Resort The Nam Hai along the coastline, where you can dine on upscale Vietnamese street food at beachfront restaurant La Sen or splurge on a spa treatment.

Nearby, Fusion Maia has become synonymous with wellness paradise, promising guests unlimited (and all-inclusive) spa treatments.

As well as the Alila Hoi An coming up soon, the area will also welcome the Dusit Thani Hoi An as well as a beachfront Rosewood Hoi An in 2021.

Side trips galore

And if you grow weary of Hoi An's charms and grace? In that unlikely scenario, there are lots of side trips around the region.

If you're into history and architecture, Hue -- the imperial capital set on the picturesque Perfume River -- deserves an overnight visit.

A three-hour drive north from Hoi An rewards history buffs with major sites like the tombs of the ancient emperors, various citadels and pretty pagodas.

Outdoorsy types will appreciate the Marble Mountains. Easy to access from either Hoi An or Da Nang, a set of stairs leads to Buddhist pagodas hidden inside the limestone grottoes."
http://cnn.com,French doctors say they found a Covid-19 patient from December,"(CNN) There's new evidence that the coronavirus may have been in France weeks earlier than was previously thought.

Doctors at a Paris hospital say they've found evidence that one patient admitted in December was infected with Covid-19. If verified, this finding would show that the virus was already circulating in Europe at that time -- well before the first known cases were diagnosed in France or hotspot Italy.

""Covid-19 was already spreading in France in late December 2019, a month before the official first cases in the country,"" the team at Groupe Hospitalier Paris Seine in Saint-Denis wrote in a study published Sunday in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents.

The first official reports of Covid-19 in France were reported on Jan. 24, in two people who had a history of travel to Wuhan, China.

Intensive care specialist Dr. Yves Cohen and his hospital colleagues wrote that they decided to check the records of earlier patients, in case the virus had been spreading undetected.

http://cnn.com,Tensions and backlash mount as US coronavirus reopenings reveal a new way of life,"(CNN) With nearly all states partially reopened this week, backlash and frustrations are growing Friday as Americans struggle with ways to combat the deadly coronavirus.

More than 45 states by Sunday will have relaxed restrictions on some combination of businesses, services or parks, hoping to lift economies crushed by a pandemic that has killed at least 77,000 people in the United States and infected over 1.2 million.

In the past week, tensions between two goals -- to keep people healthy and to get people working -- have been increasingly laid bare, with groups asserting one is being emphasized at the cost of the other.

More than two-thirds of Americans -- 68% -- are concerned about their states being reopened too quickly, according to a new poll from Pew Research Center

But after weeks of stay-at-home orders, protesters have taken to the streets for days, demanding states allow businesses to reopen. Even instructionsto wear masks to stop the spread of the virus have become a flashpoint, leading to one alleged killing in Michigan

And the dire financial news continues. The US economy lost 20.5 million jobs in April , the government said Friday -- by far the most sudden and largest decline since it began tracking the data in 1939. That's on top of 870,000 jobs lost in March. The tally for those two months is more than double the US jobs lost during the financial crisis of 2007-2008.

Meanwhile, evidence continued emerging this week that the virus is hitting certain vulnerable communities -- such as those at nursing homes and prisons -- the hardest. And there was more research suggesting African Americans may be dying from Covid-19 at disproportionately high rates.

Experts say relaxed social distancing restrictions now will make death tolls worse than they would have been. One model from the University of Washington projects 134,000 coronavirus deaths nationwide by August, nearly double its previous forecast.

One of the latest states to relax restrictions is California , which had been one of the first states to issue a stay-at-home order. Starting Friday, some retail stores may offer more curbside pickup and potentially delivery, though they should encourage social distancing, officials said.

Rhode Island will lift its stay-at-home order on Saturday, becoming the first state in the Northeast to do so, Gov. Gina Raimondo said.

But things aren't wide open yet. She warned Mother's Day on Sunday ""is absolutely not a time to visit your mom in a nursing home or an assisted living facility.""

Members of the National Nurses United protest across from the White House on Thursday. The nurses say the shoes represent other nurses who've died from Covid-19.

States are not ready to reopen, experts warn

Health experts warn that states have not met the federal guidelines for reopening , including aggressive testing and tracing, and a downward trajectory of documented cases in a 14-day period. Reopening risks setting off another wave of the pandemic and its effects will not be immediately known, experts have said.

""It will be at least two to three weeks before we see an increase in the number of infections because it takes time for individuals to infect others and for them to display symptoms,"" data scientist Youyang Gu, whose coronavirus projection model is cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said this week

The CDC has created a 17-page draft recommendation on how to reopen the economy, with details beyond what was offered last month -- including specifics for schools and churches. But the Trump administration will not implement it, a senior CDC official said Thursday

On Friday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the guidelines were still in the editing process.

""Those aren't CDC guidelines,"" she told reporters. ""Those are guidelines in draft form that a rogue employee has given you for whatever personal reason they decided to do that.""

Meanwhile, a new study illustrates how much states' loosened restrictions may increase people's mobility.

After Georgia began letting certain personal-service businesses reopen on April 24, trips to the state from across the nation rose by 13%, or 62,441 trips a day, according to researchers at the University of Maryland

Glimmers of good news appeared in two hotspots.

In Louisiana, hotspot Orleans Parish reported zero Covid-19 related deaths for the second day in a row. The state remains under a stay-at-home order until May 15 and Gov. John Bel Edwards is expected to address when the state will start reopening on Monday.

In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the hospitalization and death rates are going down and ""I feel that we are for the first time in this engagement, we're actually ahead of the virus.""

Protesters call for the state to lift stay-at-home orders and reopen the economy in downtown Richmond, Virginia on Wednesday.

Calls to wear masks become a flashpoint

To slow the predicted spread of the virus, some cities are asking people to wear masks in public places. But those guidelines have been met with resistance, leading to confrontations.

In Michigan, two incidents involving masks made headlines nationwide. In one, a Family Dollar security guard was shot dead after he told a woman to wear a face mask, officials said. Police also arrested a man who allegedly wiped his nose on the sleeve of a Dollar Tree employee who asked him to wear a mask.

Protesters have flocked the Michigan Capitol for days, demanding an end to the state of emergency in place through May 28. But Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also relaxed restrictions so some businesses can reopen and the public can participate in outdoor activities like golf and motorized boating.

In Florida's Miami-Dade County, a bus driver says that after she asked a coughing passenger to wear a mask, that person spat on her and fled . In Miami Beach, a man shouted ""this is a false flag, a fake pandemic"" in a grocery store during a profanity-laced tirade this week as a code compliance officer told him he needed a mask to enter.

The city of Stillwater, Oklahoma, revoked an order requiring residents to wear face coverings inside buildings after workers received threats.

Steven Taylor, a clinical psychologist and author of ""The Psychology of Pandemics,"" said people tend to rebel when they're told what to do, even when the measures are to protect them.

""People value their freedoms,"" he said. ""They may become distressed or indignant or morally outraged when people are trying to encroach on their freedoms.""

Unmasked protesters in Michigan try to enter the state's House of Representatives chamber but are blocked by masked Michigan State Police.

The virus is hitting hard in some vulnerable communities

As some people rebel against protective measures, the virus continues to hit hard in places where social distancing is not an option.

Thousands of inmates have tested positive for coronavirus in federal and state prisons -- many of whom showed no symptoms. In Ohio, more than 20% of the people infected with coronavirus are prisoners. And in Colorado, the state's largest outbreak is in a correctional facility.

Things are just as bad in nursing homes, where the population is especially vulnerable. In Louisiana, more than 30% of the state's coronavirus deaths are from nursing homes and long-term care facilities. In New Hampshire, they make up nearly 80% of the cases while in Arkansas, almost half of all of the state's cases are in prisons and nursing homes.

Officials in several states have called for more testing in correctional facilities and nursing homes.

""Nursing homes have been ground zero for Covid-19,"" said Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Tavern owner Jenna Aronowitz takes the temperature of bartender Shane Goode before the restaurant opens for sit down meals in Brookhaven, Ga.

It's taken a deadly toll on the black community

America has an inequality problem and the coronavirus crisis is making it worse.

The pandemic is leaving few people untouched, but the toll is far more deadly for African Americans, who are dying at higher numbers.

according to a new study. African Americans make up 13.4% of the American population. But counties with higher black populations account for more than half of all coronavirus cases and almost 60% of deaths,

Disparities, including access to health care, are likely to blame, researchers concluded.

""Structural factors including health care access, density of households, unemployment, pervasive discrimination and others drive these disparities,"" researchers said. ""Social conditions, structural racism, and other factors elevate risk for Covid-19 diagnoses and deaths in black communities.""

The study involved scientists from Emory and Johns Hopkins universities, the University of Mississippi Medical Center and Georgetown University.

Of the more than 3,100 counties researchers studied coronavirus cases from late January to mid-April, they found deaths were higher in disproportionally black rural and small metro counties."
http://cnn.com,"Thank You, Teacher: Dr. Sanjay Gupta's coronavirus podcast for May 8","(CNN) It's National Teacher Appreciation Week, and there's rarely been a more important time to be grateful for their hard work . CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta highlights some teachers' struggles and most creative adaptations to teaching during a pandemic.

You can listen on your favorite podcast app or read the transcript below.

Jimmy Fallon, ""The Tonight Show"" host: Teachers should make a billion dollars, and get more vacation time. They spend their days wrangling all our crazy kids. When they go out, they should get free bottomless wine ...

Dr. Sanjay Gupta: That's Jimmy Fallon singing on ""The Tonight Show"" earlier this week. I think voicing the thoughts of so many families. The song was a nod to National Teacher Appreciation Week, which ends today but should probably go on all year long.

Like schools across the country, the week looked very different compared to years past. Instead of apples on their desks or gift cards from parents, teachers might've received an apple emoji or some money on Venmo.

You know why. It's because 47 states and the District of Columbia have ordered or recommended school closures for the rest of the school year.

Teachers across the country have taken their lessons online to try and weather this pandemic.

So today, we'll highlight some of these teachers' struggles and successes in navigating remote learning.

I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""

Chris Dier: We had to really try to make everything work in the virtual world. And that's challenging to do because most teachers like myself, we don't sign up for that. We sign up for the interaction.

We sign up for the collaboration, and we sign up for those human moments that you can't really replicate online.

Gupta: That's Chris Dier, 2020 Louisiana Teacher of the Year and the finalist for 2020 National Teacher of the Year.

Dier: I teach at Chalmette High School in Louisiana, right outside of New Orleans.

Gupta: Dier teaches world history to seniors, and AP human geography to freshmen — I didn't know what that was. He said it's sort of like anthropology. He was inspired to teach, partly because of a formative personal experience.

Dier: I was in high school when Hurricane Katrina hit. I was a senior. It was our second week, and it disrupted, you know, the entire region down here.

I was forced to go to Texas. I stayed in hotels and shelters and bounced around different schools. I missed out on a lot of big events that a lot of people look forward to their senior year.

Gupta: Sound familiar? Dier has a pretty good idea of what his current students probably feel.

Dier: It's a time when you're supposed to be celebrating all of your hard work, your dedication, your accomplishments, when your family's supposed to watch you walk across that stage and cheer. So it's — it's a time that you'll never get to redo and you'll never get back.

Gupta: And that's not just a loss for Dier's students. Some of them will be the first in their families to graduate from high school, and the ceremony would've been meaningful to their relatives as well.

Dier has students who are also dreamers; undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children. And he has students who are working essential jobs while they also balance online classes.

Learning online might seem easy enough if you're a student with a computer or the internet, but Dier also has students who didn't have the luxury of these tools.

Dier: So a lot of students who originally didn't have internet when this happened, we were distributing work and packets and, you know, just literally papers when we were distributing food.

But my district personally has been giving Chromebooks out to students who need them and trying to collaborate with local organizations to get hot spots to get kids connected, so I think teachers all across the country are doing everything they can to get kids online and to keep that, that learning going.

Gupta: Esperanza Community School in Phoenix, Arizona, has also handed out Chromebooks and Wi-Fi hot spots to some of its students. But that's not all the school is providing. I think a lot of us forget how intergral schools are to our communities, even if you're not a student there.

Hannah Wysong teaches science and English at Eperanza, mostly to low-income students.

She has helped distribute food boxes and gift cards to grocery stores. But as this pandemic drags on, Wysong and her colleagues are looking ahead to long-term challenges families might face.

Hannah Wysong: Food is available in a lot of places from schools and food banks. But as this has gone on for a couple of months and parents are not working or working less, the next step that we're working on right now is to build a fund for rental assistance.

Gupta: And that's just the creative problem-solving Wysong has been a part of outside the classroom. After students have been set up with food and Wi-Fi is when her real job, and the real connection begins. And these teachers have come up with all kinds of new ways to do that as well.

Wysong: Something that we do normally at our school is have monthly family nights with movies or dinner or games or whatever it might be. And we were really mourning the loss of family night, and we decided to do a virtual dance party.

So we got a local deejay from a radio station, and then we invited all of the families to get on Zoom. There were, I think, between 45 and 50 people on, between families and staff. It's pretty cute to see a bunch of little squares of third graders dancing.

Gupta: Chris Wyckoff, who teaches American history to 11th graders in North Carolina, has taken advantage of our reliance on the internet to send his students some encouragement.

Chris Wyckoff: I've been sending out digital cards to let them know that I still see you. I still see your work. I still see you're working hard.

Gupta: Wyckoff has been proud of how well his students at the Johnston County Career and Technical Leadership Academy have taken to online classes. After all, they could easily just turn their video off and go do something else.

Wyckoff: Online learning, you know, it has its good and its bad even depending on the type of learner you are. And a lot of our students are capable of making the adjustment.

The conditions at home, all of those — the social and emotional atmosphere of home versus the social emotional atmosphere at school, all of those things combine to either create an atmosphere for success or failure for the students.

Gupta: Chris Dineen — this is another Chris — said there were hiccups using video conferencing at first.

Chris Dineen: We had a Zoom bomb the first or second day.

Gupta: But his middle school students at Albuquerque Academy in New Mexico have come around.

Dineen: The students themselves have had to adapt to a totally different style of teaching, and they've actually had to become somewhat more accountable for their own behavior because of course, we can't see them and monitor them in the ways that we normally do.

Gupta: Laurie Abrams finds this challenging, too. She's a special education teacher on Long Island and works with 3- to 5-year-olds who have special needs.

During normal times, her work is incredibly physical and requires personalized interactions with each student. These days, she struggles to get her students to sit still in front of the camera.

Laurie Abrams: All kids do well with a schedule, but especially kids with special needs, listening issues and attending issues. They really need that. They need that routine. And the — you know, it's very hard — it's very hard for them.

Gupta: But, like everyone else, Abrams has come up with ways to make it work. In fact, she borrowed one method of calming her students down from a children's yoga certification course.

Abrams: What I'm doing with my fingers is touching my thumb to my forefinger, middle finger, ring finger and pinkie. And so you have them do that. So it's four touches and then you just say, ""Peace begins with me."" And they understand that peace means quiet. And then we keep doing it.

And at any time when you feel anxious or that you need to calm down, you can just — you can just move your fingers like that.

Gupta: It's thoughtful. It's innovative. It's what's necessary.

The teachers we spoke to said they've mostly worked out the kinks of remote learning, and they feel optimistic about finishing the year apart from their students.

But in the long run? They're still not so sure.

Abrams: I think these kids are young enough that if it's just four months in the scheme of their long lives, this is not going to make the biggest difference because they didn't have four months of preschool.

I think that in the fall, if kids can't go back to school, if they have to learn online, I think that's going to, you know, really impact this whole generation.

Gupta: This won't surprise you, but Chris Dier, the Louisiana teacher whose own senior year was interrupted by Hurricane Katrina, said this pandemic highlights the need for more investment in education.

Dier: I know a lot of times when the economy starts to tank a bit, the first thing that gets cut is education. And people might say, well, why do we need as much, you know, money for education and budgets when they can do things virtually and whatnot.

But at this time, I feel like that we need more, because we need more counselors, we need more social workers, we need more therapists, we need smaller classes.

And that's how we're gonna get through this.

Gupta: These five teachers said the feedback they've gotten from students and parents has mostly been positive. But during this strange, difficult National Teacher Appreciation Week, it's nice for them to hear that their efforts haven't gone unnoticed.

http://cnn.com,Getting to the doctor during a pandemic,"Going anywhere during a pandemic is difficult but getting to medical appointments is even more fraught. Whether you need to get to the pediatrician, dentist, vet, internist or hospital, this five-part series from CNN Science and Wellness has you covered.

(CNN) It had been three weeks of gradually debilitating, searing pain before Johnny Staggs decided to call his local clinic for advice.

As a bariatric patient, Staggs, a 43-year-old food stamp office employee in Tennessee, had a history of dealing with hemorrhoid flare-ups, but they usually abated after a few days. He'd use over-the-counter pain medications, which alleviated the discomfort within a few hours, so there was no need to talk with his physician about it.

This time around, the medicines did nothing for his pain. It worsened to the extent where he was practically on his knees at work instead of sitting. He had to nearly stand up to watch a movie with his wife one Sunday. Housework he needed to complete went undone. He took OTC medications to get through the day, and evening versions at night since he couldn't sleep well because of the pain.

Eventually, Staggs had to take a few days off work here and there, but ultimately he had to return once he ran out of sick leave. Even there, he was falling behind.

Since the pain started up again in early March, Staggs debated whether he should request an appointment with his clinic.

""My biggest concern was thinking, you know, you just hear in the news about how everyone's rushing in to get tested for the coronavirus and everything,"" he said. ""And my thought was my issue overall seems so minor compared to if I took a spot [from] someone who had a more serious concern.""

But he also feared that leaving his pain unchecked would grow into a graver problem -- or an emergency. This internal dilemma is one many may face right now as they weigh the risk-to-benefit ratio of visiting their doctor's office.

Here's what physicians say you should consider when you're debating with yourself over an appointment.

Deciding whether to visit your doctor

Since states differ in which medical services are available and when varying services will be reopening, there's no one-size-fits-all answer for whether someone should visit the doctor, said Dr. Gary LeRoy, a family physician in Ohio and president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.

If you're thinking of scheduling an appointment or if you have one coming up, call ahead to have a clear understanding from your physician's office about what the plan is for appointments and whether staff is available, he said.

""For chronic medical issues or for issues that really are nonurgent, we also encourage patients to call their doctors first,"" said Dr. Patrice Harris, an Atlanta psychiatrist and president of the American Medical Association. ""Each patient is unique, and so once they call their doctor's office, their doctor will be able to determine if they need to come in or if they can be managed using telehealth .""

If you have a chronic health condition such as diabetes or cardiac issues, it's more important to visit your doctor since he or she may have to examine you in ways that can't be done via a telehealth appointment, LeRoy advised.

""If it's a chronic thing you may say, 'Well, I'm a diabetic; it's just a routine diabetic six-month check-in.' Well, there's a lot of things that go into this routine visit that I'll ask the patient or make routine observations about,"" LeRoy said. ""Or maybe we need to do labs at that six-month visit. So you can't assume that just because it's a routine visit that you can just put it off even longer.

""So find out what it was that your physician wanted to do that they can't do over the telephone.""

It's especially critical for those with chronic conditions and compromised immune systems and older adults to follow up with their doctors regarding in-person appointments, LeRoy said, since those factors make someone at high risk for more serious illness from coronavirus.

If you have serious symptoms of Covid-19 , you can call your personal physician for guidance on getting to the hospital for testing.

What to know about telehealth appointments

Telehealth appointments have charges attached to them, LeRoy said, so they may not be an option for you if you're running low on income or if you've lost your insurance. Insurance may cover part of the cost, and out of pocket they usually cost around $60, but your doctor's office can explain your specific options.

Whether you can opt for a telemedicine appointment depends on the nature of your medical issue, LeRoy said. Again, if you have a chronic condition that requires labs, monitoring or injections, talk with your doctor about whether a virtual visit is suitable for you.

If you've noticed a change on your body, such as a concerning blemish or lump, it probably can't be evaluated via telemedicine, LeRoy said. That's because your doctor may have to touch it to determine whether there's a problem.

If you're not tech-savvy or if you live in a rural area with weak internet connection, you can ask whether your doctor is holding appointments over the phone, Harris suggested.

Some states have restrictions on services that can be offered virtually. If you're looking to get a prescription medication refilled, ask your doctor if that refill requires an in-person visit.

Out of desperation, Staggs finally called his clinic on March 25. After waiting on hold for hours, he was told he'd be placed in a queue for a virtual appointment at 10:30 p.m. that night. But the delay went into the early morning hours and the appointment never happened, so he decided to visit the clinic later that day.

How to be safe at the doctor's office

Some physicians' offices have made adjustments to their waiting and examination rooms to keep everyone involved safe, LeRoy said. Medical staff have moved furniture apart for proper distancing, wiped down doors and supplies to manage surface contamination and are wearing masks and gloves (as usual) to prevent spreading.

""You should make sure that you have some sort of face covering when you go in there,"" he said.

You can wear gloves, LeRoy said, but realize you can still pick up the virus and touch your face. Avoid touching your face and adjusting your glasses, and learn how to remove contaminated gloves without compromising your hands

You should also carry hand sanitizer that you'll rub into your hands before and after you wear gloves. If you've touched your credit card while wearing gloves, use the hand sanitizer to cleanse your card, too.

In a clinic he remembered as usually fast-paced, Staggs was the only patient in the office at that time. The staff was diligent in their protective measures.

""When I walked in, there was a strong smell,"" he said. ""You could tell that every chair had been wiped down recently."" For his paperwork, the receptionist handed him a pen after wiping it down with a Lysol wipe. Everyone was wearing a mask.

A nurse practitioner examined him, saw his pain and referred him to a specialist who was still taking patients and could see him a week later.

She wiped down the door after he left the room.

Staggs saw a gastroenterologist, who quickly realized Staggs' problem was much worse than Staggs thought and out of his purview. So he requested that another specialist see him that same day.

After describing his pain to a colon and rectal surgeon, Staggs learned he had an anal fissure, a small tear in the tissue that lines the anus. If it wasn't for the pandemic, the surgeon would've operated on him that same day. But the operation was considered an elective surgery, so the surgeon gave Staggs a cream to use for two weeks before a follow-up appointment.

Just as every other method had failed, so did the cream.

""Because that wasn't working, he had to do a justification for surgery to get it approved from the board,"" Staggs said. ""And they were actually able to get me approved. My surgery was [April 22] at 7:30 in the morning. At 8:30 in the morning, I was awake from surgery, and I felt like a new person.""

The guidelines for safety are meant to accomplish three major goals, Harris said. Two are ensuring physicians maintain access to care for their patients while decreasing the risk of spread of Covid-19.

But overall, physicians don't want their patients to feel alone, Harris added.

""We want our patients to know that we are there for them,"" she said. ""We also don't want our patients to feel they have to make these decisions alone, and that they can call us so we can continue in the shared decision-making process."""
http://cnn.com,"California was one of the first states to issue a stay-at-home order. Tomorrow, it'll start to reopen","(CNN) States across the country continued Thursday to work toward reopening as researchers said the novel coronavirus has been deadlier in the United States than the seasonal flu.

California, one of the first states to implement a stay-at-home order , is set to begin loosening some restrictions Friday, though state Health Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly warned residents, ""It does not mean a return to normal.""

""We still know that the virus is alive in California and that your good efforts have helped us suppress it quite a bit, but it is still there spreading,"" he said.

Starting Friday, some retail stores will be able to do more curbside pickup and potentially delivery, though they should continue to encourage social distancing, Ghaly said. Manufacturers should keep workers farther apart for social distancing, and warehouse workers should have sanitation materials and use personal protective equipment during deliveries.

A new study of the fatality rate from coronavirus in the United States puts it at 1.3%, which is greater than the 0.1% fatality rate from the seasonal flu in a typical season.

Anirban Basu, a professor at the University of Washington School of Pharmacy, used publicly available data on virus infections and deaths through April 20.

The study did not include New York City, which has had the highest number of cases and deaths in the country. The numbers of cases and deaths was changing too quickly to include in the study, Basu said.

The figure is preliminary, Basu said, as it's based only on the reported cases and confirmed Covid-19-related deaths.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced Thursday that outdoor dining will be allowed to begin May 15, with dine-in services able to resume beginning May 21. Personal services such as hair salons, barber shops, spas and nail salons will also be able to open beginning May 15 with some guidelines.

Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo confirmed her statewide stay-at-home order will expire Friday and the state will start the first phase for reopening. But movie theaters, bowling alleys, museums, gyms, salons and barber shops will remain closed.

""This is not the time for social gatherings,"" Raimondo said. ""The economic devastation in this state and every state around this country is untenable. So I am focused like a laser on work, getting people enabled to work.""

More than 75,500 people have died of the virus and more than 1.2 million are infected as of Thursday in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University.

New York hospital systems no longer recommending hydroxychloroquine

One of New York's largest hospital systems stopped recommending hydroxychloroquine as a standard treatment for coronavirus patients last month, one of its top doctors told CNN.

""We were all very cautious about it to begin with. We did not feel it had a strong evidence base,"" said Dr. Thomas McGinn, deputy physician-in-chief and senior vice president for Northwell Health. ""We were doing it with some hesitation but knowing the FDA, the politicians, the family demands and lack of harm, we were doing it cautiously.""

Hydroxychloroquine has been used for decades to treat patients with diseases such as malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. President Donald Trump touted the drug as a ""game-changer"" for Covid-19.

McGinn said the hospital system began recommending the drug toward the end of March for patients who had low levels of blood oxygen saturation and didn't have heart or liver problems. He said his colleagues ""saw no side effects"" when they administered the drug to at least 500 coronavirus patients.

Patients were closely monitored for possible side effects impacting the heart with electrocardiograms.

But after a study of the drug involving hundreds of patients at US Veterans Health Administration health centers showed that patients were no less likely to need mechanical ventilation and had higher death rates compared to those who did not take the drug, McGinn said his team of doctors and administrators decided to stop using it.

Northwell Health is New York state's largest health care provider and private employer, operating 23 hospitals and nearly 800 outpatient facilities across the state, according to its website.

Vaccine approved for phase 2 trial

Potential vaccines to prevent Covid-19 infections are racing through development at unprecedented speeds. Moderna Inc. -- the first vaccine maker to start clinical trails in the United States -- announced Thursday it would soon begin a phase 2 study after getting approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.

Vaccine clinical trials involve three phases , per the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The first examines safety, while the second expands the number of participants. In the third phase, the vaccine is given to even more people and tested for effectiveness.

The President had said a vaccine would be available by December, then appeared this week to back off his claim.

But scientists won't know whether vaccines can prevent infection until April or May next year, said Dr. Mark Mulligan, director of the Vaccine Center at New York University's Langone Health, who is working with Pfizer Inc. on its vaccine trial.

""We're doing things in months that normally would be done in years,"" Mulligan said.

Phase 2 of Moderna's study will include 600 participants, the company said, up from the 45 volunteers in phase 1 . Participants older than 55 will be enrolled in phase 2, Moderna said.

Moderna -- which has never brought a product to market -- is now finalizing the protocol for the study's phase 3, which could begin in early summer, the company said in a news release.

In an investor call Thursday morning, Moderna said the first batches of the vaccine are expected to be manufactured in July, with a goal of manufacturing up to 1 billion doses a year.

There are more than 100 vaccines under development across the globe, according to the World Health Organization.

White House rejects CDC reopening guidelines

The guidance provided more detailed suggestions beyond reopening guidelines the Trump administration put forth last month, including specific suggestions for schools, communities of faith, restaurants and bars, mass transit and employers with vulnerable workers.

Concerns over the President's possible exposure to the coronavirus resurfaced Thursday after CNN learned a member of the US Navy who serves as one of the President's personal valets tested positive for the virus

Valets are members of an elite military unit dedicated to the White House and often work close to the President and the first family. A source told CNN that President Trump was subsequently tested again for the coronavrius by the White House physician.

The President and the vice president tested negative, deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley said in a statement."
http://cnn.com,The Psychological Toll of Working on the Front Lines: Dr. Sanjay Gupta's coronavirus podcast for May 6,"(CNN) Health care workers on the front lines are risking not only their lives, but also their mental and emotional well-being . CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta speaks with Dr. Steven McDonald, an emergency room doctor at New York-Presbyterian Allen Hospital, about the psychological toll of his everyday reality.

You can listen on your favorite podcast app or read the transcript below.

Jake Tapper, CNN Anchor, ""The Lead"" and ""State of the Union"": Doctors and nurses risking their lives to save you and me and patients.

Dr. Ken Duckworth, chief medical officer, National Alliance of Mental Illness: I do worry about our first responders and health care workers, in terms of the trauma they are exposed to.

Ana Cabrera, CNN Anchor: Even physicians are victims of this unprecedented public emergency.

Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Since the beginning of this pandemic, health care workers have been dealing with this virus head-on, putting their own physical health at risk.

According to a CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] report released in April, more than 9,0000 health care workers have been infected with the coronavirus. ... And because of the limited data we have, that number is likely higher.

But we shouldn't forget the other risks our health care workers are facing. I'm talking about the emotional and psychological ones.

[Pots and pans banging, people cheering for health care workers]

Gupta: Every night in cities around the world, we celebrate our health care workers. But the thing is, even before this pandemic, their jobs were demanding.

They're in high-stress life-and-death situations with long hours.

So in this episode, I want to talk about the pandemic's psychological cost to the people on the front lines -- and what's being done to help them.

I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""

Dr. Philip Breen: She was a doctor. Every bit of the word that a doctor should be. She put her life on the line to take care of other people.

Last week, Dr. Breen, a New York City emergency room doctor, died by suicide.

She had actually contracted Covid-19 herself. After recovering she went back to work.

Breen: She was like the fireman who runs into the burning building to save another life and doesn't regard anything about herself.

Gupta: There is so much about this virus that is new and unfamiliar, making everyday life more challenging.

I've heard that from my colleagues.

Every day they wonder: Are they safe? And if their families and loved ones are safe as well.

I recently spoke with Dr. Steven McDonald. He's an ER doctor at the same hospital as Dr. Breen.

He's been on the front line for weeks, taking care of patient after patient ... after patient. New York has been the US' pandemic epicenter, with more than 321,000 people infected and 25,000 deaths.

I asked Dr. McDonald about how he's coping with his everyday reality as well as the loss of a colleague, and how he's taking care of his own mental health.

Gupta: So how is life, Dr. McDonald?

Dr. Steven McDonald: First of all, things are changing day-to-day. I think life a month ago looked very different than only two weeks ago than it does today. Thankfully, emergency department volumes are significantly down.

But also, as you can imagine, the tenor of my department is depressed. We just lost one of our faculty members, one of our physicians. And so there's definitely a pall that's been cast over my department -- in addition to this pandemic.

Gupta: I'm so sorry to hear that. I don't think people always recognize both the physical and psychological toll on frontline workers like yourself. At what point for you did it become something that was personally frightening?

McDonald: As we were approaching the peak, I would walk into the emergency room and it was in a state of chaos. And it was overwhelming to an extent that I had never really seen before. It felt -- I keep describing it as though a caged animal had been kind of let loose, and no one could see it or get it back into the cage.

Gupta: Wow. You know, I've been -- I finished med school in 1993, so I've been doing this for a long time. And typically, you know, the family is there. There's an additional line of support.

But what you're describing is people who are coming in, almost always by themselves because families can't come in. And now they find themselves in a position where they may suddenly die. It's tough. I don't mean to paint it so stark, but it sounds like that is the reality, at least in some of these situations.

Let me ask: How worried were you about contracting the virus yourself?

McDonald: If I'm being honest, you know, early on, I think this was probably mid-March when this was first starting. I had a moment at home by myself, borne out of complete irrationality, where I suddenly was convinced that I was going to die of this. I can't explain to you where that came from. I think it was just maybe having read a couple too many of these cases and having talked to a couple of colleagues who had pronounced young people dead of this.

And I just suddenly was gripped by that conviction. And it was frightening. It was really frightening, just to feel like there's nothing that I can do in this. I have truly no agency over my death in some regard. There's no amount of PPE that will protect me from this. And I know that to be irrational. I know that to not be true, but I was so gripped by it in one moment.

Gupta: I agree with you, and I think that's a really interesting way to put it. You know, we do all the right things, but there are things in life, especially with a microscopic virus that's inexplicable. So you're really putting yourself at risk.

McDonald: Right.

Gupta: Did you ever think about sitting it out? Saying, you know what? It's not worth it.

McDonald: You know, I did have a moment where -- I think it was a Sunday night and I had my first shift in a couple of weeks on the Monday. And I was, to be totally honest with you, I was a wreck. I was a wreck. I was calling family and friends. And I was really upset.

And I was thinking about the number of people who I was going to have to pronounce dead or have to have end-of-life conversations with. And I found it so overwhelming in the abstract on that Sunday night.

I thankfully have a great support network, a great therapist -- and spoke with her a bit and was able to sort of pull myself together and work and be a physician the next day. But that was a difficult 24 hours.

Gupta: You know, Steven, it's always struck me that even within the medical community, there is still a stigma about seeking therapy, seeking mental health support. Yet it's so important, maybe never more important, than it is right now.

Do you sense that stigma? I mean, has it manifested at all in your life?

McDonald: I mean, you know, absolutely. I would say physicians don't talk about mental health issues. I don't know if any job is really that open about this, but I think medicine in general breeds a culture of silence about this.

Gupta: And you do hear about physicians who die by suicide. Compared to the general community, it's typically higher across the board.

There was a lot of news about Dr. Breen lately. And I know you knew her somewhat. When you heard this, were you surprised?

McDonald: Absolutely. I was completely floored. She always -- again, I only knew her in a professional capacity, but she struck me as someone who was so self-possessed and so capable, really tough as nails and able to deal with any situation head-on.

And, you know, I esteem all of my colleagues as being that tough.

Gupta: Has there been anything good that's come out of this for you?

McDonald: So I think there has been incredible camaraderie among physicians. At the peak of this, we had orthopedists and urologists coming down and managing critically ill patients and doing blood draws and doing things that are way below their level of training just to help out, and to see colleagues who were so willing to be part of this effort was really inspiring.

You know, secondly, and I think this remains to be borne out, but one hope that I have: This virus, I think is sort of peeling back the onion skin and showing us at the core of American society, things that really need attention on a federal and legislative level.

So, the inequalities that this is exposing, the problems in the health care system that this is exposing.

And I hope that these are conversations that are started and carry weight and are not forgotten after we beat this thing.

Gupta: Camaraderie as well, you're absolutely right about -- I've seen that in our own hospital. Although it does make me think of this joke that you probably heard: the definition of a double-blind study?

McDonald: No?

Gupta: Two orthopedic surgeons trying to read an EKG.

McDonald: Hahahaha. I love that. I will not be telling that to my orthopedic colleagues, but I love that.

Gupta: I want to ask you about, you know, if there's been a best moment and a worst moment.

McDonald: Yes. Worst moment for me was. ... It was during the peak, and I was coming into a shift. I received sign-out on probably 40 patients who were all critically ill.

And so I was in this awful situation where I was pulled into one room to be with a critical patient who was dying. And then the nurse comes and gets me and says, you also have a critical patient who's dying in this other room.

And so I run through to this other room, and this woman is near death. Her heart has nearly stopped. Her oxygen levels are falling. She's already on a ventilator. She was in her late 80s.

And the team is, the team of residents is looking to me, to ask: What are we going to do when this woman's heart stops, as it appears it's going to in the next 10 seconds, 15 seconds? And this woman had no established advanced directives. And we had made multiple attempts to get in touch with family and were unable to.

And, you know, all the data shows that someone of this age who's already on a ventilator, this person is not going to live no matter what interventions you make. And so, talking to you now, it seems very obvious to not attempt to prolong life. But in that moment, it was very hard for me to make that decision. It was -- there was no clarity about it.

And so, I declined to perform CPR. But then I felt terribly about that in the moment. That was really the lowest moment I've had during this, where I just felt like I ended someone's life without any data.

I guess, in terms of bright spots of this -- so you're familiar, I'm sure, with the 7 o'clock clap for providers and essential workers. And so, after Lorna Breen's passing, I was working that next day. And we did at 7 o'clock go out to the front of the emergency department.

All the doctors who were able and the nurses and everyone, and we just had a hell of a clap for those whom we've lost. And it doesn't in any way redeem what's happened. But it was a really nice moment of camaraderie and to celebrate the accomplishments of those whom we've lost, including Dr. Breen.

Gupta: Wow. Well, I mean, going back to the worst moment for a second, for what it's worth, Steven, that was a tough decision. I'm sorry that obviously left such a mark on you. But from what you described, you know, it was the correct decision.

McDonald: Thank you.

Gupta: Do you worry that you're suffering from post-traumatic stress?

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

McDonald: It's hard to say. I mean, I think like post-traumatic stress disorder, when you're in the thick of it, you don't think about it. And it's only once things calm down that you begin to have things like flashbacks or intrusive thoughts.

So far, I've been very fortunate in that I have not had those symptoms, but I can't tell you with any certainty that I won't in the future. And so that is a perpetual source of anxiety and concern.

Gupta: Well, I mean, I will clap harder and cheer even louder after hearing your story about how that made you feel. I mean, it's the least I think that people can do and people really owe you a debt of gratitude. So, thank you very much.

There'll be books written about the sort of work that you've done. I know you're in the midst of it right now, so it's hard to sense that, but thank you.

McDonald: Thank you. Thank you so much.

Gupta: Like Dr. McDonald said, doctors are facing so many challenges right now. There are these long, demanding shifts, the risk of exposure to the virus and the number of patients that are dying, which is unlike anything we have ever dealt with before.

Dr. John Krystal, Yale University professor of psychiatry and neuroscience and Yale-New Haven Hospital chief of psychiatry: You know you think of the first wave of illness being the wave of patients coming in and presenting with illness. But for these health care workers, the stresses are somewhat cumulative.

And so you can think of a second wave of stress coming through for the Covid health care workers.

Gupta: That was Dr. John Krystal. He heads the psychiatry department at both Yale University and Yale-New Haven Hospital. He's been tasked with leading a group that identifies health care providers who are struggling and provides them with support.

Krystal: One kind of support that we have is giving people a place they can drop into any day they want, every day, five days a week. We have what we call stress and resilience town halls. They're open to everybody in the community: staff, trainees, doctors.

The idea was they should connect to deal with the isolation that they're often feeling. They should unload, you know, they should just share what it is that they're going through and then to learn a few skills. And so we teach people relaxation skills, and we teach people sleep hygiene. And so far, I think in our community, over 1,400 people have made use of them.

Gupta: Dr. Krystal and his team also established a buddy system -- pairing health care workers with their peers. And then they dispatched volunteers to provide psychological support to anyone who wants it, over the phone.

But both Dr. Krystal and Dr. McDonald bring up a more deeply rooted issue about the culture of medicine.

Krystal: You know, some of the challenges are that some of the characteristics that we have historically admired most about physicians: They're willing to sacrifice themselves for others, their reluctance to complain about things.

All of those are admirable, wonderful traits, but somehow, we haven't always inculcated in the values of our medical system that self-care is as much a duty and a responsibility as caring for the patient.

And my hope is that this is an opportunity to have broader discussion about that. And to make it OK for more doctors who need help to seek help.

Gupta: This pandemic has really tried and tested the best of us.

But I am thankful that mental health services are available for our doctors and medical workers who need it the most.

A fund was recently set up in honor of Dr. Breen -- it's called the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes' Fund, and it's there to provide mental health services to medical workers.

It's my sincere hope that the support that's been marshaled to help health care workers in this pandemic will last beyond this moment -- that they'll become a fixture in the way we think about care.

We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening."
http://cnn.com,Go online or cancel? Summer camps try to adapt to a pandemic,"(CNN) Mythmaking and swordplay are among the usual activities at Camp Half-Blood, which operates day camps in several mid-Atlantic states, including New York and New Jersey.

But with coronavirus looming over the summer season, there may be a need for new kinds of magic and myths.

When schools began to close in March due to the escalating Covid-19 crisis, it became clear to Crystal Bobb-Semple, founder and CEO of the company that operates Camp Half-Blood, that she needed to start devising new scenarios.

The summer camp might consolidate weeks, delay starts or maybe go online. ""We began to think about and imagine what a virtual camp experience could look like,"" she said.

Like so many institutions, summer camps are facing uncertainty about whether they'll open and how they'll reinvent themselves if they do. Many are making contingency plans — sometimes several sets of them.

""Camp should not and will not look as usual this summer,"" said Paul Dreyer, CEO of Colorado-based Avid4 Adventure camps, which traditionally hosts both sleepaway and day camps.

Camps in the US South often start earlier than northern ones; some have already canceled . Northeastern camps still have a little wiggle room.

At the end of April , the Centers for Disease Control and Phrevention released a 17-page draft of operating guidelines for businesses, including summer camps, but decisions will ultimately be made locally and in partnership with health officials. Suggestions include keeping beds 6 feet apart in sleepaway camps and keeping small groups together without mixing.

Together, 6 feet apart

Those considerations were already well underway for most camps. The conundrum is social distancing. How can kids packed in groups singing, playing and, for sleepaway camps, tucked into cabins stay 6 feet apart?

""That phrase, 'social distancing,' is not really in a camp's vocabulary,"" Ron Hall, executive director of the nonprofit Maine Summer Camps , said.

Avid4 Adventure's staff spent the last five weeks furiously reimagining day camp.

Due to the pandemic, summer camps like Colorado-based Avid4 Adventure, whose campers are shown here in better times, have been scrambling.

They devised three new scenarios, including ""Small Group Adventures."" This approach would match one counselor to five day campers, who would be dropped off at trailheads or reservoirs for safe-distance adventuring. ""Camp at Home"" would match four kids to one instructor, with online instruction and meetups at nearby green spaces.

At Camp Equinox , a theater day-camp in Bozeman, Montana, the possibilities connect to what schools are considering. ""We could have class on alternative days, to cut down on the number of kids,"" Soren Kisiel, co-camp director, said. If camp is on, ""We'll have gallons of hand sanitizer on hand, and we'll be very carefully monitoring our staff and interns for any signs of illness.""

Taking camp online

Avid4 Adventure's final option is virtual: 15 kids and one instructor, online. It's a tough pill for some to swallow, when camps generally provide an antidote to the overly screened existence many kids had before the pandemic, which has intensified.

""Our last option is to keep kids inside,"" Dreyer said. ""Our mission is just the opposite."" But he knows that some kids or their parents are in high-risk groups or can't travel.

The American Diabetes Association, which hosts 6,000-plus kids with Type 1 diabetes in 55 summer camps across the US annually, is unfolding Imagine Camp

There will be cabins with relationship-building games and activities like scavenger hunts that kids can do at home, along with diabetes education. The upside is that it can connect kids who wouldn't otherwise meet, but the ADA will also mail kits to those who can't or don't want all-day screens.

Making camp safe for everyone, rich and poor

Though few kids have had serious complications from Covid-19, some counselors and camp directors are older and in higher-risk groups. Access to testing could make or break camp this year. If sleepaway camps can regularly screen kids and staff, they may become some of the safest spaces.

But wealthier camps may be better able to access and provide testing, should it become available. ""For smaller and nonprofit camps, costs like testing can become prohibitive,"" Hall said.

The inequality that the pandemic is exposing and exacerbating may be replicated in the world of summer camps. Camps also need to have the resources to set up an isolation tent, should an outbreak occur, suggested Hall.

Camp is where the heart is

Camp is, for many parents, childcare — it will be an incredible challenge for parents to work with kids stuck inside and no school to engage them. Some camps for kids with physical or emotional challenges are the only respite their caregivers get all year.

Camp Joy in Clarksville, Ohio, annually serves 4,000 kids with hardships, including those living with diseases like spina bifida and others who are in foster care. ""Some of those kids only see their siblings once a year at camp,"" Jennifer Eismeier, Camp Joy's executive director, said.

Trying to transform an online experience into something inclusive and emotional is challenging. Camp Equinox, like many theater camps, draws some kids who feel like outcasts during the year, but feel safe and supported at camp. ""That's the mission of our camp, to instill in these kids a sense of community so they're working together and supporting each other,"" Kisiel said. ""I can't imagine delivering that online."" Though he's willing to try.

Camps and money conundrums

With some camps canceling, others reducing enrollment and others going virtual, the thorny question of finances for camps that charge tuition remains. Some are offering refunds, with the hope that donations can keep camp going.

So far, two-for-one is popular: Don't ask for a refund now, get next year free. Early in April, Camp Half-Blood rolled out a membership program. Those who commit will see their campers automatically reenrolled in 2021 if their weeks are canceled this year, with early registration and a permanent tuition reduction.

Heartbreak and hope

Whatever happens, the uncertainty and loss are palpable for kids, parents, counselors and camp directors.

After spending weeks preparing for multiple scenarios, and then soul-searching and conferring with its board and many other camp directors, Hidden Valley Camp , a sleepaway camp in Maine, decided that it would suspend programs this summer, for the safety of everyone. ""The operative word is heartbreaking,"" said Hidden Valley's co-director Peter Kassen.

Many feel summer camp is more important than ever, an antidote to the isolation haunting so many kids, a screen detox and a dose of resocializing before —hopefully — school restarts in the fall.

And if it can't happen? ""A few months from now, regardless of what happens this summer, every camp will be thinking about the summer of 2021, and there's going to be a lot of excitement about it,"" Kassen said."
http://cnn.com,"Gainesville has become hot spot for coronavirus cases in Georgia, a state just starting to reopen","(CNN) Although the new coronavirus has been spreading through the United States for months, and there are cities seeing a flattening of the curve, some areas of the country have recently begun to find an uptick of cases.

Some of these hot spots are in states that have just begun allowing businesses to reopen.

In Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp said the state will open a temporary medical pod in cities such as Gainesville, about an hour northeast of Atlanta.

Gainesville is ""being stressed pretty hard ... at the moment,"" Kemp said Tuesday. The governor mentioned last week that while some areas of the state have seen reduced cases, Gainesville has an increase and area hospitals have had more hospitalizations.

The high number of daily hospitalizations for Covid-19 has continued this week.

Gainesville, with about 40,000 residents, is the county seat of Hall County, home to several poultry plants.

Kemp was in Albany on Tuesday, where another of the mobile units with about 20 beds was opening for non-Covid-19 patients. Speaking about the Gainesville pod, he said they'll set it up but hope it's not needed.

""But it's going to be there in case we do. And that'll be a good regional spot, you know if something happens in Athens or anywhere across northeast Georgia, north Georgia,"" the governor said.

Another unit will be set up in Rome, Georgia, the governor said.

According to data from Johns Hopkins University, 19 states are seeing an upward trend in new confirmed coronavirus cases over the past 14 days. The number of new cases appears to be going down in 13 states, and 18 states appear to be at about the same levels.

Some states may see their counts rise because they are confirming more cases through better testing or because new infections are increasing.

It's still too early to determine whether reopening actions have resulted in more cases and deaths, and it may take several weeks for the effects to become apparent.

Georgia began allowing some nonessential businesses such as gyms, barber shops, hair salons, tattoo parlors and bowling alleys, to reopen April 24 with restrictions on physical distancing.

A CNN analysis shows that Georgia has had a relatively consistent number of daily new cases since April 24. In this period, the seven-day average of the number of new cases per day has only been as low as 628 and as high 769, and the overall trend remains relatively steady.

Lawsuit: Federal prisoner sprayed with disinfectant

Prison officials sprayed disinfectant on an inmate who collapsed and spit up blood at a federal prison in New Jersey on April 20, according to a lawsuit filed Monday by the ACLU of New Jersey and attorneys representing four ""medically vulnerable"" inmates at the correctional facility.

The inmates filed a class action lawsuit against warden David Ortiz and Michael Carvajal, director of the Bureau of Prisons, seeking temporary release for themselves and others who are medically vulnerable at the Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution.

A spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons declined to comment, citing pending litigation.

At least 4,893 incarcerated or detained people have contracted Covid-19, and at least 88 have died, according to a report released Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The CDC report puts the number of staff members who have tested positive at 2,778, with 15 deaths.

The findings are based on data from 37 state and territorial health departments. The CDC reached out to 54 jurisdictions, but about 30% didn't provide requested information on jails and prisons.

Still, the CDC found that 420 correctional or detention facilities across the United States have reported infections -- resulting in at least 491 coronavirus-related hospitalizations among detainees and 79 hospitalizations among staff. Researchers looked at cases reported through April 21.

""Approximately one half of facilities with Covid-19 cases reported them among staff members but not among incarcerated persons,"" the report said. ""Because staff members move between correctional facilities and their communities daily, they might be an important source of virus introduction into facilities.""

Differences in testing between states also could have influenced the number of reported cases, researchers said.

No states that is reopening has met White House guidelines, researcher says

While more states lift stay-at-home restrictions , none have met all of the White House's guidelines on when they can safely start to reopen, a researcher from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said.

""To my knowledge, there are no states that meet all four of those criteria,"" said Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins.

She described the four criteria at a House Appropriations Subcommittee on Wednesday:

""The first is to see the number of new cases decline for at least two weeks, and some states have met that criteria. But there are three other criteria and we suggest they should all be met,"" Rivers said.

Those include having ""enough public health capacity to conduct contact tracing on all new cases, enough diagnostic testing to test everybody with Covid-like symptoms"" and ""enough health care system capacity to treat everyone safely.""

But the US still hasn't done enough to protect residents from the coronavirus pandemic, said Dr. Richard Besser, former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The US must overcome major obstacles to help prevent a resurgence of coronavirus, he said. As of Wednesday, more than 1.2 million people in the US have been infected, and more than 73,000 have died , according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

""We don't have the testing capacity now to know where this disease is,"" Besser said.

""We have not scaled up the thousands and thousands of contact tracers that we need , we don't provide safe places for people to isolate or quarantine if they are identified as either having an infection or being in contact

'Wake up, world. Do not believe the rhetoric'

Researchers are discovering new information about how early and how rampantly this coronavirus has been spreading.

A new genetic analysis of the virus taken from more than 7,600 patients around the world shows it has been circulating in people since late last year, and must have spread extremely quickly after the first infection.

""The virus is changing, but this in itself does not mean it's getting worse,"" genetics researcher Francois Balloux of the University College London Genetics Institute told CNN.

At most, 10% of the global population has been exposed to the virus, Balloux estimated.

Such a low percentage means the fight against coronavirus is far from over, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

""Think how much pain, suffering, death and economic disruption we've had in getting from 5% to 15% of the population infected and hopefully protected,"" Osterholm said.

""Wake up, world. Do not believe the rhetoric that says this is going to go away.""

http://cnn.com,The opioid epidemic was already a national crisis. Covid-19 could be making things worse,"(CNN) Before the Covid-19 pandemic , the nation was in the throes of another public health crisis: the opioid epidemic .

More than 2 million Americans struggle with opioid use disorder, and about 130 Americans on average die every day from an opioid overdose. Opioids account for a majority of drug overdose deaths, the leading cause of accidental death in the US. It's a crisis that's been a priority for officials at the federal, state and local levels for years.

Now, the coronavirus has disrupted all matters of life across the country -- including efforts to combat the nation's opioid problem.

Walk-in clinics and syringe exchange programs have been closed. Community support groups are meeting virtually.

Some who struggle with substance abuse are homeless or incarcerated and can't comply with social distancing guidelines, while those who can are left isolated and at risk. On top of all that, the pandemic is causing massive stress -- a primary driver of relapse.

""This changing, very strange world that we're living through could serve as a trigger for people to return to drug use,"" said Daliah Heller, director of drug use initiatives at the public health organization Vital Strategies. ""And that brings a great potential for overdose with it.""

As local officials report spikes in overdose calls and deaths, experts and advocates say they're concerned the coronavirus pandemic is making an already serious problem worse.

Local officials are reporting overdose spikes

County coroners, law enforcement and emergency responders around the country are reporting spikes in overdose calls and deaths -- and they're concerned that's connected to Covid-19.

Franklin County, Ohio, reported 28 non-fatal overdoses from last Friday night to Saturday night. The previous Friday, the county had six overdose deaths, which coroner Anahi Ortiz had described as a ""surge"" in a Facebook post

Sixty-two people died of overdoses in the month of April alone, she wrote. Ortiz wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday that Franklin County had seen a 50% increase in fatal overdoses from January to April 15.Sixty-two people died of overdoses in the month of April alone, she wrote.

Niagara County in New York reported last month that drug overdoses spiked 35% from January 1 to April 6, compared to the same time last year.

And in Jacksonville, Florida, the fire and rescue chief said the city saw a 20% increase in overdose calls from February to March.

It's too soon to determine whether such reports are evidence of a larger trend, said Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Federal and state data on fatal and non-fatal overdoses for the past few months are not yet available, while coroners and medical examiners are overwhelmed with cases of Covid-19 and may not have the resources to follow up on overdose deaths, she said.

""We do not know,"" Volkow said, of whether more people are overdosing in connection with Covid-19. ""In many cases, we will likely never know.""

But she predicts that some communities will ""absolutely"" see an uptick in overdoses.

Public health services are disrupted

There are a few reasons that experts are concerned about a potential coronavirus-related increase in opioid overdoses.

For one, harm reduction programs across the country have been experiencing reduced capacity given the pandemic, Heller said.

An addiction treatment clinic in Olympia, Washington, operates outside to reduce the risk of Covid-19 infection.

Though many states have defined such services as essential in their stay-at-home orders, some programs have had to restrict access or reduce staffing because of a lack of funding or personal protective equipment for their workers.

Federal agencies have eased some regulations that have mitigated the risks of overdoses and Covid-19 infection, Heller said.

For example, patients receiving medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder often have to visit a provider daily for a dose of methadone. But because such visits could expose both patients and health care workers to Covid-19, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is temporarily allowing treatment programs to provide patients with two to four weeks' worth of methadone doses to take home.

Meanwhile, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has also relaxed telehealth restrictions around prescriptions for buprenorphine, another medication-assisted treatment.

Still, for people who lack health insurance or high-speed internet access, there are barriers.

People are engaging risky behaviors

In some communities, services that treat addiction or prevent overdoses, such as needle exchange programs, are on hold -- leading people to engage in risky behaviors.

Jamie Favaro is the founder of Next Distro, a harm reduction organization that provides syringes and the overdose-reversing naloxone online and through the mail. She said her organization is receiving about five times as many requests as usual because people haven't had access to sterile syringes. A significant volume of requests is coming from people in Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia, she said.

Outreach workers deliver a bag of fresh food and package of Narcan, the opioid reversing medication, to a person staying in a Delaware motel.

Recently, she said, a client in West Virginia requested syringes after sharing a single needle with three other people for a week. The exchange programs in their area were shut down, the client said, and there was nowhere else to get syringes. Other clients have reached out saying they are also reusing syringes or have had needles break off in their skin, she said.

""I'm very fearful that we're going to see an HIV spike and a Hepatitis C spike, as well as an overdose spike in areas where the needle exchange programs have shut down,"" Favaro said.

More harm reduction programs around the country are beginning to mail syringes and naloxone to people who use opioids, Favaro added. County health departments are ramping up naloxone distribution to protect against overdoses too.

But the coronavirus pandemic presents challenges there as well.

When someone overdoses on opioids, another person generally administers naloxone to reverse those effects. Because of social distancing, Volkow said, it's possible that some individuals may not have anyone else around to administer the life-saving medication.

The drug supply is affected

Another reason people are at heightened risk of opioid overdoses has to do with how Covid-19 has affected the nation's illicit drug supply, experts say.

Illegal drugs are typically smuggled into the US from other countries, but border restrictions brought on by the pandemic could theoretically decrease drug access in some areas, Volkow said.

On the surface, Heller said, that might seem like a good thing. But a limited supply could drive dealers to increase the potency of products to meet demand, mixing powerful, synthetic opioids like fentanyl into drugs and putting those who use them at a greater risk of overdose.

Less access to drugs could also drive users to seek out other, unfamiliar drug sources -- or risk withdrawal.

Stress could drive people to relapse

Finally, the social isolation brought on by the coronavirus pandemic is leaving people especially vulnerable.

Some support groups for people experiencing opioid addiction or for those in recovery are now taking place over Zoom, Volkow said. But the virtual contact often just isn't the same.

""One of the most powerful interventions is to keep people in treatment is that social network,"" she said. ""Isolation can lead you to seek out some relief, like starting to take drugs.""

It will be a while before we know the true effects that Covid-19 has had on those who struggle with opioid use disorders, Volkow said. But already, there are many reasons to worry."
http://cnn.com,Creating your advance directive or living will during a pandemic,"The 44-year-old doctor in Palo Alto, California, has an underlying immune deficiency, but has ""never had shortness of breath before,"" she said.

Her test came back negative for coronavirus. But whatever has been plaguing her, Covid-19 or some other respiratory condition, resulted in two trips to the hospital.

She's nervous about her future during the pandemic, and she recently contacted her friends to discuss her own end-of-life decisions, she said. In the past, she's had these kinds of discussions with patients many times.

""We don't want to want to feel guilty for making those decisions for them. It breaks families apart,"" Mac said. ""It's kind of silly for me not to have prepared with all the things I've seen.""

Now she feels the need to confront the questions herself, and she's appointing her parents to make decisions on her behalf should she become unable to do so.

Mac's conversations with those close to her parallels those of frontline health workers, patients and their families, and really, anyone who thinks the pandemic could affect them. Many more people have been forced to think about their own mortality sooner than they would have imagined.

On April 30, her 44th birthday, she called an attorney about creating an advance directive and a will. ""I'm planning on moving forward with having that drafted and properly managed,"" Mac said.

These life-or-death decisions are marked by a sea of of medical and legal paperwork. Here's what you need to know in order to start putting your plan in place.

There's a spike in people writing out their wills

""People know now they need these documents,"" said Renee Fry, founder and CEO of Gentreo, a company that enables people to create and store a number of critical legal documents, including those that appoint health care proxies, delineate advance directives and spell out a last will and testament.

She said that amid the pandemic, the platform has recently seen a 223% increase in the past month in users creating paying memberships.

On top of that, users' age distribution has ""changed dramatically,"" she said. Prior to the pandemic, a typical user creating a will and other documents was between 50 and 67 years old. Now new sign ups come from ""across the age spectrum,"" ranging from ages 28 to 72.

of social distancing, she and her colleagues frequently field questions about whether documents can be witnessed remotely. Many states have In this timeof social distancing, she and her colleagues frequently field questions about whether documents can be witnessed remotely. Many states have emergency orders allowing people to witness documents electronically, or deeming estate planning an essential service.

""People don't fully appreciate what failure to be plan would mean for them,"" said Mary Kate D'Souza, Gentreo's chief legal officer. ""It can create a legal morass that you're just not prepared for.""

It's a time to have meaningful conversations with loved ones

The most important thing, experts noted, is that if you're apprehensive about end-of-life planning, you don't have to get everything perfect on the first go. You have every opportunity to come back to these documents as often as you need or want to in order to make adjustments.

It could be at major life milestones, including your wedding, the birth of a child, a divorce or a new diagnosis. It could also be an annual check-in.

""The joy and meaning and purpose of it is to talk about it with your loved ones,"" said Adam Hayden, a 38-year-old philosopher living with brain cancer. ""This is an act of love.""

Hayden frequently writes and speaks around the country about the need to confront the most essential end-of-life questions.

At age 34, he was diagnosed with glioblastoma, which carries with it a 15- to 18-month median survival time. Each year since then with his wife and three kids has been a blessing. ""I will happily update my documents each year,"" he said.

For many, end-of-life planning can feel morbid. To ease the awkwardness, the Coda Alliance, a group that seeks to empower people to take ownership of end-of-life conversations, created a ""Go Wish"" card game for families to play together.

Another way to ease into the conversation is with the Five Wishes workbook , which helps structure necessary decisions on one's physical, emotional, mental and spiritual needs.

Appointing a health care proxy

The first step is to appoint a health care proxy, someone who can make decisions or sign documents for you if you become incapacitated.

It's imperative that you have someone you trust who can do those things for you, said Liz Salmi, who herself has been living with brain cancer for 12 years. At age 29, she appointed her boyfriend of one year (now her husband) to be her decision maker while she was being wheeled into an emergency brain surgery.

""The hardest part is the health care proxy,"" Salmi said. ""When you're young, you don't think about these things. But families can be torn apart by what happens.""

In appointing your personal proxy, you need someone whose values are aligned with your own. If you want to be taken off a respirator or a feeding tube, you need someone who can strongly advocate that position for you if you reach a point when you can't.

Salmi's advance directive gives concrete examples.

""CPR won't cure brain cancer,"" she said, so she rules out lifesaving measures in some circumstances. On the other hand, ""If I fall into a frozen lake, I would be OK with CPR.""

Salmi has worked in the health care field, focusing on palliative care and electronic health records. Coupled with her own experience as a chronic cancer patient, she's spent more than a decade thinking deeply about how to get these questions right.

After examining dozens of examples, Salmi ultimately made her own advance directive and put it on her website for anyone to see. And she pointed to the American Bar Association's website as another resource for finding estate planning forms focused on health care proxies and advance directives.

""It's not a medical document,"" Salmi said. ""It's a quasi-legal document."" She recommended that people keep a hard copy and their own electronic copy of their documents, because they don't automatically transfer in electronic health records.

Outside of health care settings, you'll need a power of attorney document, which would enable a friend or loved one to make financial and legal decisions on your behalf.

Beyond managing your bank accounts and property, it's now increasingly important to think about how someone will manage your digital footprint after you die.

""I want my LinkedIn page deleted,"" Salmi said. And when the time comes, she wants her Facebook page turned into a memorial page.

Creating your advance directive

Your advance directive spells out your wishes on whether doctors should try to resuscitate you or keep you alive if you're at the edge of death. For Covid-19, that might specifically include guidance about ventilators and assistance with breathing. More broadly, that can also address such concerns as artificial nutrition and hydration.

It's impossible to know which health care decisions you or a proxy will be forced to make in the future, especially if you're young and healthy. But Hayden's and Salmi's experiences living near the shadow of death help light the way.

The advance directive is the ""shortest way to guarantee what (someone wants) will happen with their treatment,"" Hayden said.

He explained that legal experts commonly prepare power of attorney documents, rather than medical experts. But based on his years of living through the complex technical aspects of a terminal diagnosis, he advised people creating advance directives now to talk about their documents with their doctors as well.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

""Even if you think you're providing the support you think you need, it may not be useful in a medical context,"" Hayden said. He appointed his wife as his proxy, but his guidance is that she can make the decisions in partnership with a physician, because the intricacies of brain tumors can't always be predicted in a standard legal contract.

Failing to create a plan not only subverts your own wishes. It can cause pain years after your death in those you love as they fight about the right thing to do. In the absence of a formulated plan, many families are at risk of fracturing on divisive questions about whether or not a family member should receive certain lifesaving treatments or whether doctors should use measures to prolong someone's life.

Facing the decision

Back in Palo Alto, Mac is leveraging her experiences as a physician into making all these decisions for herself, should things go downhill for her.

Prior to entering into biomedical research at Stanford University, she treated patients in a Detroit hospital, where she frequently saw young people who had been in car accidents or who suffered gunshot wounds as a result of gang violence. They hadn't always identified someone to make decisions on their behalf.

""It's kind of silly of me to not have prepared with all the things I've seen,"" she said. ""I told my parents I need to get this handled.""

Following her flu and respiratory episodes recently in the emergency room, she's been experiencing new neurological symptoms, including dystonia, a movement disorder. And whether or not her breathing issues were a false negative for Covid-19, she's still worried about her body's inability to create certain immune cells.

As she ventures further into the unknown, though, Mac can have some assurance that others with chronic diseases have had to stare down these demons and learn that the decisions can actually create peace in the midst of this present global chaos.

""Now is the time to start having these conversations,"" Salmi said. ""Use what's happening in the news as a trigger."""
http://cnn.com,Getting to the hospital during a pandemic,"Going anywhere during a pandemic is difficult but getting to medical appointments is even more fraught. Whether you need to get to the pediatrician, dentist, vet, internist or hospital, this five-part series from CNN Science and Wellness has you covered.

The 41-year-old living in Toronto had a history of kidney stones. She had been feeling some renal colic symptoms recently, a type of pain that can indicate the stones are worsening.

But during the coronavirus pandemic, routine medical appointments get a little more complicated . Was it worth it to go in? ""It was a solid 'maybe,'"" she said.

On April 15, she had a six-month follow-up appointment for a kidney ultrasound at Toronto Western Hospital. Although other hospital departments weren't seeing patients during the pandemic, radiology was still open -- with strict social distancing rules.

If her kidneys went unchecked, she worried there was a possibility she'd end up in the ER in June passing kidney stones.

Many of us will face our own version of Sue-Wah-Sing's decision in the coming months. So here's what you you need to know if you're going to the hospital, clinic or doctor's office in the time of coronavirus.

Call your doctor first

""Emergencies still continue to happen,"" said Dr. Patrice Harris, president of the American Medical Association. During the pandemic she advised patients to still call 911 for urgent needs, particularly chest pain or stroke symptoms

Beyond that, though, Harris cautioned that there's no ""one-size-fits-all"" approach"" when assessing whether or not you should go for an in-person hospital visit.

That's likely to be determined by your individual case, the health care available in the patient's area and the severity of the Covid-19 environment in your region.

But Harris noted there was still one constant through all of that: shared decision-making. ""Patients shouldn't need to make decisions alone about whether their problem is urgent or emergent,"" she said.

Certain new symptoms or follow-ups for existing conditions might warrant starting with a telehealth appointment with your doctor. If it turns out you need to go to the hospital, call the hospital ahead of time to learn which entrance to use to avoid areas where Covid-19 patients are receiving treatment.

""Please don't let the pandemic stop you from reaching out to your physician,"" Harris said. ""You don't want symptoms now to go unreviewed and then turn out to be worse later.""

Decide with your doctor whether you should seek care in person or online

In the US, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has published a tiered framework to help explain how hospitals can still offer certain in-person services during the pandemic.

In the first tier, the guidelines recommend postponing in-person hospital visits for routine primary care, preventive medicine and services such as supervised exercise therapy.

In the second tier, initial visits for services such as evaluation of nonurgent symptoms consistent with Covid-19, pediatric vaccinations or early childhood care can be done via telehealth, with subsequent follow-ups at appropriate care sites.

The third tier describes the most acute issues, and the government's framework recommends proceeding directly to in-person hospital or clinic visits. In these instances, CMS urges patients to seek in-person care if forgoing it would result in harm.

One immediate rule of thumb to determine is whether you'd be capable of calling for help later if you don't now, said Doug Lindsay, a personal medical consultant who advises patients on how to seek care for complicated conditions.

If there's a likelihood of heart attack, stroke or severe injury, get the patient to the emergency room.

""If you're struggling to breathe, then you want an ambulance because the ambulance is a mini-hospital,"" Lindsay said. ""If you're just sick, then have someone drive you.""

If you're unsure whether it's the right move to go to the hospital, calling the doctor's office or their after-hours exchange can help get you answers before setting out into an uncertain situation.

""You should be calling their exchange and talking this through,"" Lindsay said. ""There's nothing new about calling that [number].""

Stay protected, and physically distanced, at the hospital

Hospitals can be busy, high-traffic areas with lots of people, which is why Lindsay advised patients to lower risk by seeking care at smaller clinics or urgent care centers, rather than sprawling hospital centers.

And if you're choosing between urgent care clinics, look for one that provides X-rays in-house. That way you don't have to take the risk of a second trip to another health facility.

When you walk in to a clinic or hospital, you're likely to have your temperature taken or to be asked

While waiting for an ultrasound to discern whether or not she had kidney stones, Dia Sue-Wah-Sing sat in a waiting room in which unused blocks of chairs created physical distancing between patients.

questions about your symptoms. This is designed to screen out whether you might have Covid-19.

When Sue-Wah-Sing walked into Toronto Western for her kidney ultrasound, she was given a yellow ""PASS"" sticker signifying she cleared the hospital's Covid-19 symptom screening. And while the hospital has seven entrances, it had kept only four open to be able screen each person entering the building.

Patients weren't allowed to bring visitors with them, unless they were providing translation or another essential service. And the hospital's food court was still serving food, but it had taken away the chairs and tables so people couldn't congregate there to eat.

On the way up in the elevator, she saw three pairs of little yellow feet painted on the floor, showing both the number of people allowed in the cramped space and how they could position their bodies each 6 feet away from each other.

Finally, in the radiology department's waiting room, groups of five seats were all roped off, so that patients could maintain social distancing by only sitting in every sixth chair.

After seeing all the extra measures in place, Sue-Wah-Sing said she felt being at Toronto Western Hospital during the pandemic was actually ""one of the safest places to be.""

After Sue-Wah-Sing underwent the ultrasound in the Toronto hospital, she went straight home to have a telehealth appointment with her doctor to discuss the results.

Prioritize your own health

Start out with keeping a daily log of your symptoms. One key part of deciding whether to go to the doctor is to keep a log of your symptoms every day, noting how severe they are along with where you were or what you were doing as the symptoms came on.

""Every doctor tells every chronic disease patient to do that,"" Lindsay said.

Understanding her past health challenges and knowing how to monitor her own symptoms was key to Sue-Wah-Sing making the right call to go the hospital.

It was a risk to go in, especially at this phase of the pandemic, she said. She would have considered canceling the six-month follow-up had she been symptom-free. And her symptoms were still mild enough that she felt she could have afforded to wait a few more weeks for the ultrasound if it had already been scheduled further out.

""But it was totally worth it,"" she said. ""If it had ended up being a stone, I'd have been in the ER."""

Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Two weeks before Dia Sue-Wah-Sing had a previously scheduled doctor's appointment in April, she started experiencing some pain in her side.

But with concerns of Covid-19 cases overrunning hospitals, Dia was faced with a question many of us are asking right now: Should I still go in to see my doctor?

Today, we'll talk about when to seek care not related to Covid-19, and how doctors and hospitals are reaching their patients from a distance.

I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""

Sue-Wah-Sing: It's like, running and being dehydrated and having like a significant cramp on your side.

Gupta: At the beginning of April, in the middle of this pandemic, Dia Sue-Wah-Sing began having some pain. At first, she didn't know what it was.

Sue-Wah-Sing: Oh, maybe I just like slept funny, or you know, sometimes you're like, maybe I'm just sitting in a weird spot because we're all doing a lot of Zoom and trying to get cozy for those. But I'd had it for a while, and I had it for a few days.

Gupta: Then, Dia began to recognize the symptoms. She has a history of kidney stones and realized that that would explain the pain.

Fortunately, Dia was scheduled for a routine ultrasound on April 15. Because she was nervous about Covid-19, Dia initially wasn't sure if she should go in for her appointment. So she called the hospital and spoke to a nurse about what they were doing to keep patients safe.

Sue-Wah-Sing: She talked about general precautions that the hospital had in place. So there are checkpoints, they have less entrances open. You know, there is kind of that basic medical screening. So, you know, have you traveled? Do you have a fever? Do you have a new cough?

Gupta: After speaking with the nurse, Dia decided to go in for her appointment. So, on April 15, she drove to the hospital and had an ultrasound of her kidney.

Sue-Wah-Sing: And it was like kind of being at the airport. There were two booth setups that were legitimately like health-screening checkpoints.

So it's like there's hand-sanitizing stations, sanitize your hands, come to the booth, say who you are, check in. And in the waiting room, they had it cornered off. And they had 2 meters or 6 feet apart for the waiting room chairs. So you could only sit in selected chairs.

Gupta: Dia was in and out of the hospital in less than an hour. Later that day, she got a call from her doctor to discuss the results.

Sue-Wah-Sing: We went through my symptoms, my imaging. And the next steps. So I thought it was kind of nice because I think sometimes your physicians don't always look at your stuff until you're like, hold on. Who are you again?

But I think they have the time to take a breath right now, that they actually are coming to the table prepared in the telemedicine appointments. So it's like, huh, this is the most efficient it's been. I should do this all the time. Instead of, you know, being there for two-thirds of the day.

Gupta: Because of the coronavirus pandemic, Dia's experience has become a common one. Hospitals have quickly taken their services online, doctors are seeing their patients on video or over the phone, and medical records are being shared more often electronically. It's a process that minimizes exposure to the virus and could also save people some travel and wait time.

These practices are a part of what's known as telemedicine. The number of medicare beneficiaries who received telemedicine visits rose from 10,000 a week to 300,000 a week in the last week of March, according to the Wall Street Journal.

To learn more about it, I spoke to my colleague Dr. Gregory Esper, a neurologist and also director of telemedicine at Emory University.

Gupta: Whenever I'm looking at new technology as a doctor, but also as a journalist in the back of my mind, I'm asking myself, is this technology just a substitute for what already exists or is it adding value in a way that this technology can do differently in some way?

How about with telemedicine? Is it just a substitute for an in-person visit? Or can it do things that you otherwise wouldn't be able to do?

Dr. Gregory Esper, professor and vice chairman of Emory University's department of neurology: One of my favorite examples is there was a Parkinson's patient who was falling at home, and the Parkinson's physician looked at their environment and noticed that there were multiple trip hazards in place on the floor and directed the patients to take care of all of those trip hazards by moving the shoes or moving this or moving that to clear walkways.

So that is something we haven't seen before, which is an advantage to telehealth. But here's another one. Let's say that the patient desires more frequent contact with their provider, but they live 200 miles away. Telemedicine becomes the venue by which that contact happens.

Gupta: So as a neurologist, if you're doing a telehealth visit the right way. What does that entail? What does that visit look like?

Esper: Well, it starts far before I see the patient. It starts when our staff is contacting the patients and asking them if they would be comfortable to do a telemedicine visit. Then we schedule the appointment, and we'll have the medical assistants prep those patients. And then the patient will be ready for the physician.

And then we open the video and then we, we actually begin the conversation with a consent. We actually will ask the patient, is it OK for us to continue with this telemedicine visit? And the patient will generally say, yes.

And then we proceed. We do the history. Tell me about your headache? What side is it on? Patient might point to the side. Is your vision affected? Do you have nausea? And we then proceed to a physical examination.

There are so many things that we can do on video that will help us confirm our hypothesis for what's happening in the history.

Gupta: When the patient is seeing you or the health care provider on a screen, what are you seeing in addition to the patient? Are you able to look at previous laboratory values that the patient may have had drawn through their blood or previous scan results?

Esper: Everything that is accessible in an in-person visit is accessible in a telemedicine visit. And we have actually implemented systemwide capabilities for image capture where we are asking the patients to upload their MRIs, or their prior scans, or we can obtain those from partner organizations that have electronic connections with us.

Gupta: It's been really interesting, Dr. Esper, with my kids at home and doing Zoom school. You know, one of the things that comes up sometimes with three kids is just the speed of the connection and then downloading things at the same time.

How much of a factor is that just in terms of the quality of the online services?

Esper: Well, I think it ranges from people who actually don't have internet service in their area, for which we do telephonic visits, to those who have spotty coverage, in which the video is a little bit choppy.

And part of getting comfortable with the technology is learning how to mitigate those factors during the examination.

Gupta: Because of the novel coronavirus, the government has temporarily allowed Medicare and some other health insurers to cover these sorts of procedures. We're going to see how that carries out going forward. But how is the coverage?

Esper: Medicare has really stepped up and has made it easy and not a barrier, I would say, for patients to get care because the reimbursement is at parity compared to what it was before.

Gupta: I remember hearing at the White House when they said there is going to be a significant investment in telehealth necessary, because of the contagiousness of this virus.

How much has telehealth changed? Just even over the last few months now?

Esper: Well, I can give you some statistics from Emory. We basically were doing zero outpatient telemedicine at the beginning of March.

Since that time, we have trained and certified almost 2,200 physicians, residents, fellows to do telemedicine and do it in the right way. And we have seen almost 50,000 patients since the beginning of March through audio video telemedicine.

Gupta: So from basically zero, as far as patient care, to 50,000. Is this now here to stay? Or will it go back, do you think, once the Covid pandemic is addressed?

Esper: Well, I can tell you that my hope is that it is here to stay because I think it is a critical care model for us to be able to continue, especially for those patients who have difficulty making it to appointments, that potentially need more frequent follow-up; for patients where you need to see them in their own environment, which is their home.

And we hope there is no going back. It's not the solution for everything, but it certainly is an arrow in our quiver for how to take care of patients effectively.

Gupta: Telemedicine is being used for so many health services right now. So, for those of you who are wondering whether you can or should get your mammogram, see your dentist, take your child to the pediatrician, see someone for your mental health. ... Here's what CNN found:

For preventative check-ups, like mammograms or colonoscopies, until things change, you might have to wait until your hospital reopens before doing it. But do check with your doctor for details.

For parents, if it's urgent, try to take your child to the ER at a chidren's hospital, if possible. If it's not urgent, talk to your primary care doctor and get their advice.

As for dentists, they're unfortunately at very high risk of catching the virus because it spreads through droplets of saliva in the air. That's why most dentist offices have canceled everything but emergency procedures. But no matter the situation, still call your dentist, and they'll walk you through it.

If you're hearing a pattern here, you're right. The bottom line is, if you're feeling unwell, still call your doctor. They may even have more time nowadays to take your call. They can help you figure it out and make the safest possible plan for your care.

But if it's an emergency, especially if you're experiencing chest pain, or shortness of breath, or stroke symptoms, don't hesitate then. Just call 911 and get to the nearest emergency room.

We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening."
http://cnn.com,"While she treated coronavirus patients, the US denied her a green card","(CNN) A New York doctor who's been treating coronavirus patients says she's still reeling days after getting a devastating letter: Her green card application was denied.

""I'm putting my life on the line every day to do this, and it's just blowing my mind right now that they are not appreciating it or they don't see the value in what I'm offering to do,"" Dr. Julia Iafrate told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Tuesday. ""I'm honestly beside myself. It's like a slap in the face.""

Iafrate is an assistant professor at Columbia University Medical Center who specializes in sports medicine. But she says she wanted to volunteer to work on the front lines as coronavirus cases spiked in her city.

""Because I'm a doctor,"" Iafrate said, ""because that's what I do, because I know that I can help.""

Iafrate, who immigrated to the United States from Canada, says she's lived in the US for 13 years, completing a residency program at the Mayo Clinic and a sports medicine fellowship at the University of Iowa. For almost three years, she's been working at the Columbia University Medical Center. And she's been a team physician for the USA Ski Team and Columbia University Athletics, according to a profile on the medical center's website

http://cnn.com,Should you take your child to the pediatrician during a pandemic,"Going anywhere during a pandemic is difficult but getting to medical appointments is even more fraught. Whether you need to get to the pediatrician, dentist, vet, internist or hospital, this five-part series from CNN Science and Wellness has you covered.

(CNN) It was after midnight when Leslie Rowe woke up on April 11. Her 9-year-old son, Zaiden, was in tears, saying he had an intense pain in his groin.

At any other time, said Rowe, who lives in Collierville, Tennessee, she would have headed straight to the emergency room. ""He was crying, he was in pain,"" Rowe said. ""I was scared.""

But Rowe's family has been practicing strict social distancing since March 13. With close relatives whose preexisting conditions make them especially vulnerable to Covid-19, she's even limiting trips to the grocery store as much as possible.

Rowe called the emergency room at Spence and Becky Wilson Baptist Children's Hospital in Memphis, then decided it was time for Zaiden to go in. While Rowe stayed at home with her toddler, Zaiden's father took him to the children's hospital's emergency room.

Dr. Jennifer Shu, a pediatrician at Georgia's Children's Medical Group , said Rowe made the right call by reaching out to a children's hospital.

""If you can take them to a children's ER, that's the best way to go,"" Dr. Shu said. ""Coronavirus isn't hitting children as severely as it is adults. At least in our area, that means that children's hospitals are way less busy than the adult hospitals.""

As Americans adjust to social-distancing during coronavirus, many are wondering how best to care for their children's medical needs.

""A lot of them are just nervous about going out because they don't want to be exposed to anything,"" Dr. Shu said. ""They're being very cautious, which is great.""

But Dr. Shu also said that some medical issues require a face-to-face visit and doctors are taking measures to ensure patient safety at offices and hospitals.

For midnight emergencies, routine care, wellness checkups and more, here's what you need to know.

What should you do during a medical emergency?

For urgent issues, Dr. Shu said parents should still call 911 or go straight to the emergency room, preferably at a children's hospital.

In less pressing cases, she suggested starting with a call to a primary care provider, who can help determine next steps.

""Your primary care doctor is considered your medical 'home,'"" she said. Like other medical providers, many pediatricians are now offering telemedicine via video call or telephone. Even if you end up going to the office or to the emergency room, calling first can help ensure you find the appropriate care.

In the weeks since coronavirus quarantines have begun, Dr. Shu said that one common problem is accidental poisoning

""Kids are getting into things while parents are trying to work,"" she said. ""The supervision may not be the same during the day, and everyone's a little bit off their routine."" Poison control is still available by phone and online throughout the coronavirus crisis.

In addition to poison cases, Dr. Shu said her office has seen lots of household injuries. Kids are swallowing coins or falling down inside and outside the house. Some, she said, are getting hurt while riding bicycles and skateboards.

Those injuries are normal, said Dr. Shu, whose own daughter needed an ER visit after falling and cutting her arm three weeks ago.

""If you're trying to work,"" she said, ""try having a little bit of extra supervision on your children.""

What if your child has symptoms or is feeling sick?

If your child is experiencing symptoms, Dr. Shu recommended starting with KidsDoc Symptom Checker , a website operated by the American Academy of Pediatrics . There, parents can get reliable info on everything from stomachaches to sprains.

""Let's say [they have] a minor fever for just a day,"" Dr. Shu said. ""If the child is doing otherwise well, they may be able to manage that fever at home for another day or two.""

The next step is to call your doctor to see whether the issue can be diagnosed via telehealth or requires an in-office visit. Dr. Shu noted that at her clinic, a telemedicine call followed by an in-office appointment within 24 hours would likely be billed as a single doctor's visit.

Despite the dangers of coronavirus, and the challenges of parenting during quarantine, Dr. Shu said that it also means kids are shielded from some common illnesses.

""People aren't traveling as much,"" she said. ""They're not mixing germs as much.""

It's a silver lining to all that social distancing and handwashing: In the time since the quarantine began, Dr. Shu's office has seen far fewer cases of influenza, strep throat, stomach ailments, measles and whooping cough.

Managing vaccines and annual check-ups during coronavirus

With a 4-month-old baby and a 6-year-old at home, Lauren Bachan of San Jose, California, was concerned about the risk of contracting Covid-19 at a doctor's office.

Still, when her baby's regular vaccinations were due, she decided that delaying would be far more dangerous. ""I don't know if she's going to catch Covid,"" said Bachan. ""But if she catches measles she could die.""

When it comes to children who are 2 years old and under, Dr. Shu agreed that it's essential to attend regular checkups and scheduled vaccinations. The vaccines administered at that age protect against life-threatening diseases including measles, polio and diphtheria.

Not only that, pediatricians use regular visits with children 2 and under to check vision, screen for autism and monitor development of speech and walking. ""It's something we want to get on the radar early so we can intervene if necessary,"" Dr. Shu said.

For some of the CDC-recommended vaccines, children get additional booster shots at 4, 11 and 16 years old, Dr. Shu said. In a situation where seeing a provider is difficult or risky, Dr. Shu said it's perfectly fine to delay some shots.

""There's a one- or two-year leeway where you can wait a little while,"" she said.

For older kids who don't need vaccines, Dr. Shu said annual checkups can often be postponed as well.

""Those kids typically come in because they need to get checked out before they go to summer camp or do sports,"" she said. ""Those aren't happening anyway, and we feel that we can delay those."" If you're considering putting off booster shots or annual checkups, it's still a good idea to check with your health care provider.

What can you expect at the doctor or emergency room?

When Rowe's son, Zaiden, arrived at the emergency room in Memphis, Tennessee, he and his father had their temperatures screened before they got to the front desk.

Both father and son were wearing masks — Leslie Rowe has been working overtime to sew fabric masks for her community. After the temperature screening, they spent a few hours at the hospital making sure Zaiden was okay. All of the providers they interacted with wore masks and gloves.

Those are just some of the measures that hospitals and pediatricians have put in place to protect patients and staff from Covid-19, Dr. Shu said.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

""We're looking to the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) for guidance on precautions to take in the office to prevent the spread of illness,"" Dr. Shu said.

That guidance includes extra sanitization and maintaining social distancing as patients arrive and wait for providers.

""Rather than coming to the front desk, they check in from their cars,"" Dr. Shu explained. ""We have rooms that are dedicated to sick people that well people don't ever go in. And we're really limiting the time that they're in the actual office.""

With those precautions in place, Zaiden got the care he needed then returned home, where he's now recovering with his family.

That meant his mom could get back to sewing masks. So far, she's made 360. ""I just leave them in a basket at my front door for people to pick up,"" she said.

""They can actually pick them up and drop them off at our local hospital,"" Rowe said. ""Beyond that, I just pray for the people that are in contact with the virus."""
http://cnn.com,The doctor who battled the 1918 influenza pandemic is a lot like Dr. Fauci,"He advised Americans to cancel social gatherings and wear masks in public.

He warned of a disease resurgence if restrictions were lifted too soon.

He was also born in the 19th century.

Before there was Dr. Anthony Fauci , there was Dr. Thomas Tuttle, a Washington health commissioner who shepherded the state through the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic.

Dr. Thomas Tuttle was a bespectacled physician whose advice for ending the 1918 influenza pandemic closely mirrors the guidance Dr. Anthony Fauci has shared in 2020.

The comparison was first made in April by Crosscut, a nonprofit newsroom that concentrates on the Pacific Northwest, and Forbes

A century separates the two physicians, and they worked under different circumstances: Tuttle was a state official and Fauci is a national advisor on coronavirus. Tuttle communicated his health recommendations via telegram and Fauci appears weekly on TV. And the pandemics of their eras were two very different beasts.

But the two have shared similar advice for ending pandemics -- social distancing, masks and quarantine among them. And it doesn't hurt that the two bespectacled physicians look alike.

He raised the notion of asymptomatic transmission

In battling the 1918 influenza pandemic, Tuttle raised the notion of asymptomatic transmission, though he didn't call it that.

In the Washington Board of Health's Twelfth Biennial Report , published in 1919, Tuttle wrote that a ""carrier"" was a ""person who has been exposed to a disease but who is apparently immune from that disease, and yet will carry with him or her the germs of the disease and transmit them to others.""

Dr. Anthony Fauci sounded alarms about asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus in January, two months before it would become a pandemic. Dr. Tuttle drew the same conclusion in 1918.

He noted that among passengers on a steamship traveling from Nome, Alaska, to Seattle, Washington, 150 of them showed signs of influenza. This was despite no reported cases of influenza in Nome -- proof that the vessel must have carried asymptomatic passengers.

Now, community spread is a hallmark of the virus. Fauci said he believed asymptomatic transmission was occurring in January, two months before the coronavirus would become a pandemic.

Asymptomatic transmission is the reason health officials today changed their stance on masks.

He recommended strict rules

Like Fauci, Tuttle asked the public to make fairly drastic changes to weaken the virus's spread -- and that includes social distancing and wearing masks.

""All public gatherings except those absolutely essential to the maintenance of life and to the prosecution of essential war industries were prohibited,"" Tuttle wrote.

Nurses care for victims of the 1918 influenza pandemic outdoors in canvas tents.

He advised people to wear masks in public and quarantine themselves (to the chagrin of the public, but more on that below), too. In a retrospective, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that these efforts were ""applied unevenly.""

His strategy for Washington state seemed to work, though: With early intervention and a nascent vaccine, Tuttle wrote that the death rate from influenza in the state was ""as low as any state in the US, if not lower than any other state.""

He faced pushback

As with Fauci, not every arm of the government -- or the public -- agreed with Tuttle's proposed restrictions.

In a telegram to the US Public Health Service, Tuttle asked how long a period of quarantine should last for patients with the virus.

""Service does not recommend quarantine against influenza,"" the service responded.

In 1918, after about six weeks of social distancing (though it wasn't called that then), Tuttle wrote that restrictions were lifted -- and within two weeks, infection rates quickly grew.

He warned of a resurgence

Despite the progress the state and nation had made in quelling the pandemic, Tuttle warned of a resurgence later in the season. Though the 1918 influenza outbreak began in the fall and peaked in winter, he warned that it could peak again in the following winter after a relatively mild summer.

""Our fight with this disease is not finished,"" he wrote. ""In fact, we are simply in the midst of it. We must, therefore, be prepared to meet the situation.""

He turned out to be right -- the pandemic stretched into spring 1919. By its end, at least 50 million people worldwide had died from it, including 675,000 Americans.

The coronavirus death toll in America isn't suspected to near that -- more than 135,000 deaths is the latest figure cited by the White House -- but a US resurgence is all but guaranteed

""I'm almost certain it will come back, because the virus is so transmissible and it's globally spread,"" Fauci said during an Economic Club of Washington webinar last week.

Fauci predicted the coronavirus will resurge in the US in the fall and winter, just as flu season kicks off. To prepare for it, Americans must be ready to resume stay-at-home orders at a moment's notice."
http://cnn.com,His pregnant wife was killed in a mass shooting. Her dying wish was for healthcare workers to have PPE,"Ottawa, Canada (CNN) There was a long pause on the phone before Nick Beaton could finish his thoughts on how to best plan the funeral his wife deserves.

""I'm not sure exactly, I'm not sure now, we're basically waiting until ..."" Beaton said.

And then there was the catch in his voice, it was loud and clear.

""...until we have Kristen back home.""

Beaton is remarkably composed as he copes with his grief, now complicated in unimaginable ways by the coronavirus pandemic.

His wife Kristen Beaton was murdered on her way to work as a healthcare worker in rural Nova Scotia two weekends ago. Police say she was a victim of Canada's deadliest mass murder , pulled over by a gunman impersonating an officer.

Over the course of 12 hours between April 18 and 19, the suspect rampaged through this quiet, rural corner of Canada, shooting some people dead and setting fires that killed others.

In all, 22 people lost their lives. Police say the shooter knew and targeted some of his victims; others, like Kristen, were complete strangers.

In normal times, there would have been a wake and a funeral by now for Kristen, meaningful hugs from friends and family. But at the moment, none of that is possible.

With Nova Scotia still on lockdown like much of Canada, gatherings of more than five people are banned. Beaton has decided to put off planning a funeral for the time being.

On Sunday, family, friends and strangers did what they could to help Beaton and his son grieve with a memorial parade retracing the route Kristen took to work that morning. Dozens of cars joined a slow, steady procession, some with balloons, flowers and notes pinned to bumpers and windows.

""We're not rushing it, we'll do it classy and the best we can with this whole Covid thing we have going on. I mean we won't have full closure, everything's different, right? We won't have full closure until we have something as a family,"" he said.

Beaton spoke to CNN from his home in Nova Scotia while watching his 3-year-old son Dax play in the yard. He says he is trying to stay strong for his wife and son, but some moments are just too much.

""I tell you I absolutely lost it this morning at home, I had been holding it together. He's got this old cell phone of ours, he said he was going to pick up the phone and call his Mummy,"" Beaton said.

He and Kristen had special plans for this week.

""She was pregnant with my unborn baby,"" Beaton said, his voice trailing off for a moment. ""I know in my heart what it would be like if she was here right now, we had the whole week planned out because I was off too. We were going to get the spare room ready for the baby.""

While the tributes have poured in for the victims of the massacre, it is Beaton's plea for what he said was his wife's dying wish that has touched a nerve across the country.

Kristen Beaton posted an image of herself in a mask days before her murder.

""Kristen up until her last breath only had two surgical masks. Kristen, herself, had two surgical masks a day up until Sunday, that's all she had, nothing changed,"" Beaton said.

As a frontline healthcare worker, Beaton says Kristen worried that without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), still in short supply in Canada, she would bring the virus back home to her little boy.

But Canada's lack of preparation in protecting the elderly has taken a toll. Elderly residents of care homes make up nearly half of the country's deaths from Covid-19 -- and workers in these facilities are dealing with an acute shortage of PPE.

Canadian government and public health officials have described the global competition for protective equipment like a ""wild west"" where no rules apply. Canada has established its own supply chain in China and is working to produce more domestically. But for healthcare workers like Kristen, who look after vulnerable people in long-term care centers or private homes, there is still a severe shortage of gear.

Beaton says Kristen already believed her life was in danger when she left for work on the morning of the massacre. Her fears were not about a gunman, but an insidious virus that she felt unable to protect her family from.

Canadian politicians say they have heard Beaton's plea loud and clear. Beaton told CNN that the Premier of Nova Scotia said he was proud of him for voicing his concerns and that Kristen would have been proud. He recently spoke to the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who assured him he was doing everything he could to get PPE to healthcare workers like Kristen.

There is also help from an unlikely source. Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds and hockey Olympian Haley Wickenheiser announced on Twitter that they would work with charities to send PPE to Nova Scotia, in honor of Kristen.

Beaton says the cause deserves a ""big mouth"" like him, and that he feels in some way his wife's passionate plea for protection will change things for healthcare workers throughout Canada and beyond.

""Kristen just wanted to go to work and be safe just like everyone else,"" Beaton said. ""I want to get Kristen's voice heard while people are listening."""
http://cnn.com,"9 of the 22 victims of the Nova Scotia rampage died in fires set by the gunman, investigators say","(CNN) Newly released details about a murder rampage that spanned 16 crime scenes are as puzzling as they are disturbing.

The attacks in Nova Scotia unfolded over the course of 12 hours between April 18 and 19.

Of the 22 people killed, 13 were shot and nine died in house fires, Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Tuesday.

RCMP said the gunman also killed or wounded animals and pets that he found at the homes.

Police believe Gabriel Wortman, 51, acted alone in the shootings and arsons. He posed as a police officer, wearing an RCMP uniform and driving what looked like a police cruiser during a lengthy manhunt across the Canadian province,police said.

Wortman died after a confrontation with authorities.

Now, Canadian police say they've expanded their investigation into the US as they continue to speak to witnesses and search for a motive.

The RCMP would not elaborate on the nature of the investigation in the US. But last week, police said they believe Wortman acquired at least some of his weapons in the US.

Investigators said the gunman had several semi-automatic handguns and at least two semi-automatic rifles, one of which witnesses described as a military-style assault weapon.

The gunman wore a real police uniform

RCMP is investigating how the gunman was able to impersonate a police officer.

He owned several RCMP replica vehicles and wore an authentic RCMP uniform during at least part of his murder rampage, Superintendent Darren Campbell said.

The gunman had relatives who retired from the RCMP, but they did not assist him in any way, police said.

The motive remains a mystery

Police say the gunman attacked his girlfriend prior to the lengthy rampage, but the motive for the string of attacks remains a mystery.

His girlfriend was seriously injured and is helping police with the investigation.

RCMP said it will speak to more than 400 witnesses as it tries to determine the motive.

""It doesn't appear in terms of what we've seen that he was purposefully targeting women,"" Campbell said.

""It would appear as if he was just targeting individuals that either he knew or individuals for whatever reason that I don't think any of us will either understand or comprehend.""

An officer was among the 22 killed

The victims included RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, whose vehicle was involved in a head-on collision with Wortman's car.

Heidi Stevenson was a 23-year veteran of the RCMP and a mother of two.

The gunman shot Stevenson and took her handgun and ammunition before killing a bystander, police said. He set both Stevenson's cruiser and his car on fire.

Family and friends of the victims have said an emergency alert by police could have prevented some of the deaths.

Police have admitted they failed to issue a timely alert to the public.

""We hear the families of the victims full force,"" Campbell said Friday. ""They have every right to ask these questions, and they have every right to be angry.""

Police have said that they learned about the gunman's clothing and vehicle from a witness between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Sunday.

The formal process for issuing an alert was started, but it took several hours to make its way up the chain of command, police said. Nearly three hours later, an alert had still not been issued.

Nick Beaton, whose wife Kristen was killed in the attacks, said he believes an alert would have saved Kristen's life.

""I guarantee that without a shadow of a doubt, because I would not have let my wife leave that morning,"" Beaton said. ""Not a chance.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the failure to issue an alert would be part of a larger investigation.

""I think there are many families grieving incredible losses right now who are asking themselves questions about how things could have been different, how they might have been able to be warned earlier,"" Trudeau said.

""Those are extremely important questions that I know will be addressed through the investigation's conclusions."""
http://cnn.com,Canada says its coronavirus death rate continues to spike despite a slower growth rate,"Ottawa (CNN) Canada has a higher coronavirus death rate than previously predicted, even though the country has a growth rates slower that most countries -- including the United States -- according to a new snapshot and updated modeling Tuesday.

The epidemic growth rate was doubling every three days, but now has slowed to doubling every 16, Canadian public health officials say. But Canada is now reporting nearly 3,000 coronavirus deaths, much higher than originally predicted.

""We are seeing the tragic paradox of the epidemic playing out,"" said Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, during a presentation of the new modeling Tuesday.

""As the epidemic comes under control, and the growth of cases slows, the severe outcomes and deaths continue to accrue, as Covid-19 takes a heavy toll among highly susceptible populations,"" said Dr. Tam.

Less than two weeks ago, Canadian officials had predicted a case fatality rate of about 2.2%. It now stands at 5.5% with hundreds more deaths possible in the next week alone.

http://cnn.com,A historically grim US jobs report should be a reality check for investors,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here

London (CNN Business) The economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus pandemic is about to come into plain view.

What's happening: The jobs report issued by the US government for April, due Friday , is expected to show that layoffs surged last month and unemployment rose to Great Depression levels.

Economists surveyed by Refinitiv predict that the US economy shed 22 million jobs in April, by far the largest number on record. (The US government's monthly jobs data dates back to 1939.) The official unemployment rate could skyrocket to 16%.

Investor attention will focus on details that aren't usually subject to as much discussion. Goldman Sachs, for example, said it will look closely at the number and share of workers on furlough or temporary layoff.

""If job losses are concentrated in this segment, it would increase the scope for a more rapid labor market recovery when the economy eventually rebounds,"" chief economist Jan Hatzius told clients.

Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, said he plans to scrutinize the data on hours worked.

Analysts may need to justify the current valuation of the S&P 500, which has rallied nearly 29% from its low point on March 23, should we see hours notably decreasing, with a good portion of those still employed at ""risk of falling back to working 30 hours per week,"" he said.

For weeks, stock valuations have appeared at odds with the economic realities of the moment — a tension the April jobs report is likely to bring into stark relief. Strategists have pointed to the unprecedented support from central banks as a key factor, with interest rate cuts and massive bond-buying programs easing financial conditions and helping markets recover.

But bad economic news will keep surfacing the question: Have investors gone too far, too fast given the risks that remain?

Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told clients that a second wave of infections as countries reopen their fragile economies could force stocks to retest March lows.

""That's not the scenario we expect,"" he said. ""But in all wars, there are setbacks and lots of uncertainty.""

Uber sees a crisis that lasts quarters — not years

Uber UBER has seen ride-sharing plummet in recent weeks as the coronavirus pandemic has halted travel. But CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told investors that he's confident the crisis will not disrupt business over the long term.

""We believe the disruption caused by Covid-19 will impact our timeline by a matter of quarters and not years,"" he said on a call with analysts Thursday.

The details: Rides dropped by 80% globally in April, but there are early signs of recovery, per Khosrowshahi. The company thinks the United States has already hit its low point, noting that bookings rose last week by 14% in New York City, 8% in San Francisco and 11% in Chicago.

Bookings in large cities across Georgia and Texas, which have begun the process of reopening, have jumped 43% and 50% from their lows, respectively. The company expects the recovery to vary by region, with some areas improving while others retreat.

Khosrowshahi said Uber still wants to achieve profitability, but the company has withdrawn its guidance on earnings for the rest of the year. Last quarter, it lost $2.9 billion. In the meantime, it's cutting costs; Uber said earlier this week that will eliminate about 3,700 full-time roles, or roughly 14% of its staff.

Bright spot: Uber Eats has seen an ""enormous"" spike in demand. The question is whether these gains are temporary, or the coronavirus will cause consumers to change their habits for good.

Investor insight: Shares of Uber are up more than 7% in premarket trading, with investors showing some relief after bracing for the worst.

The bankruptcies will keep coming

Another major US retailer has filed for bankruptcy as the coronavirus continues to take its toll on business — and more companies are expected to claim insolvency in the weeks to come.

The latest victim: Neiman Marcus. The company said in a statement Thursday that it entered into a restructuring agreement with creditors that will allow it to ""substantially reduce debt and position the company for long-term growth.""

Fitch retail analyst David Silverman notes that both Neiman Marcus and J.Crew, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this week, had significant debt loads following leveraged buyouts that became impossible to manage in the current environment.

""The debt burden ultimately proved insurmountable, particularly given near term operating challenges related to the coronavirus pandemic,"" he told clients Thursday.

JCPenney JCP Hertz HTZ On the radar: Analysts don't think Neiman Marcus will be the last domino to fall.andare also contending with significant debt.

Hertz got an emergency lifeline from its lenders this week after missing a payment on April 27. The car rental company now has until May 22 to develop a new financing strategy.

http://cnn.com,"Gilead may have a breakout coronavirus drug in remdesivir, but how do you market a pandemic treatment?","New York (CNN Business) In a matter of weeks, remdesivir has gone from a shelved, failed hepatitis C treatment to the center of a national effort to treat patients suffering from Covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.

The situation has thrust the pharmaceutical company behind the experimental drug,, into the spotlight. The company's stock is up nearly 20% from the start of this year, and investors have begun to wonder about potential returns from remdesivir. At the same time, it has sparked questions from lawmakers and activists about whether — and just how much — a company should be able to profit from a pandemic.

Still, experts caution that it's fartoo early to tell if remdesivir will be an effective treatment for Covid-19, and one worth paying for. Even if it is, there is enough uncertainty surrounding the trajectory of Covid-19 that it will be difficult to determine whether the drug has long term business potential for Gilead.

Gilead CEO Daniel O'Day said on the company's first quarter earnings call this week that ""it's too premature"" to tell what the business model for remdesivir might be.

""Our focus will be on making sure we come up with a sustainable model that allows us to provide remdesivir to patients around the globe, that is intent on providing access and affordability,"" O'Day said. ""We're just now going through the clinical data, the demand scenarios, the regulatory approvals.""

Experts say it is important for the company to strike a balance between pricing the drug affordably and making at least enough money to recoup the $1 billion it plans to spend on development costs for remdesivir this year. The price could also be important for incentivizing Gilead and other drug companies to continue developing potentially crucial treatments.

""They need to have some sort of assurance that they will recoup their investments,"" Piper Sandler analyst Tyler Van Buren said.

There are currently no treatments or vaccines officially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for Covid-19, the virus that has now infected more than 1.2 million Americans and killed more than 73,500 in the United States.

A promising potential Covid-19 treatment

Earlier this month, the FDA issued an emergency-use authorization for the use of remdesivir to treat hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19, after a government study showed positive preliminary results for the use of the drug. An emergency-use authorization is a lower regulatory bar than full FDA approval.

In late April, Dr. Anthony Fauci announced that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' (NIAID) study showed remdesivir had a ""clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery"" from coronavirus.

The study showed patients who took remdesivir recovered faster than patients who did not. The drug improved recovery time for coronavirus patients to 11 days from 15 and demonstrated numerical benefits to mortality — the number of patients who died of Covid-19 — though there were too few participants to prove at this point that remdesivir reduces mortality with statistical significance.

control group, limiting the conclusions that could be drawn. Gilead also announced topline results from its own Phase 3 trial evaluating remdesivir given to hospitalized patients with severe coronavirus. That study pointed to the potential success of even just a five-day treatment course, though the Gilead-run trial had nocontrol group, limiting the conclusions that could be drawn.

Gilead has donated its existing supply of 1.5 million doses of the drug to the US government to be distributed to Covid-19 patients. O'Day, Gilead's CEO, said on the earnings call the company has been ramping up production since January, and hopes to have enough supply to treat more than 1 million patients by year-end.

The company says it has not yet made a decision about how much it will charge for the drug after the donated supply is depleted.

""Given the continued uncertainty in the trajectory of the pandemic and in remdesivir clinical data, it's premature to define what the right post-donation business model is to create a sustainable long term supply for global needs,"" CFO Andrew Dickinson said on the call, adding that the company plans to provide an update on its earnings call for the June quarter.

In theory, the drug could be a ""blockbuster"" for the company, even if it were moderately priced, Raymond James analyst Steven Seedhouse said. If the company's reaches its hoped-for treatment of 1 million Covid-19 patients by year's end and more in 2021 even at a price of several hundred dollars per treatment, Gilead could be looking at close to a billion dollars in revenue in a relatively short time period.

But Seedhouse said he's skeptical the company will charge for its work.

though the NIAID study is still gathering evidence on that. It's also unclear just how long demand for the drug will last, given the ""I think it would be public image suicide for them to charge for this drug,"" Seedhouse said, especially because, as of yet, no study has shown with any statistical significance that remdesivir reduces mortality from Covid-19though the NIAID study is still gathering evidence on that. It's also unclear just how long demand for the drug will last, given the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine

Other analysts have taken a similar stance.

""The company should be commended for its efforts in so quickly addressing this public health emergency,"" JPMorgan analyst Cory Kasimov said in a recent note.""But we still feel it's unlikely to result in tangible, long-term cash flows,"" JPMorgan analyst Cory Kasimov said in a recent note.

Profiting amid a pandemic

Some lawmakers and activists have called on Congress to intervene to ensure that remdesivir and other potential Covid-19 treatments and vaccines are priced affordably.

""To beat this pandemic, it's clear we need better laws that regulate drug corporations to ensure that everyone — no matter where they come from or what they look like — can afford Covid-19Reme treatments,"" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a release. ""That's why I'm calling on Congress to take swift action to crack down on pandemic profiteering.""

drugs or vaccines developed with taxpayer funds."" Industry experts say such intervention from Congress would be unusual. Advocacy group Lower Drug Prices Now is circulating a petition that calls on Congress to include in a coronavirus relief package ramifications requiring ""fair and reasonable prices for all Covid-19developed with taxpayer funds."" Industry experts say such intervention from Congress would be unusual.

But running up the cost of remdesivir, if it is proven effective in treating Covid-19, could be deeply harmful to Gilead's image, according to Seedhouse. Preserving the company's reputation, he said, may end up being more valuable than recouping the $1 billion it plans to spend this year on development, research and manufacturing work on remdesivir.

""This is a company that spends billions every year anyways on research and development that doesn't pan out,"" Seedhouse said. ""Or is it worth more to be the poster child for a responsible biopharma company that's doing the right thing? ... The sentiment and perception of the company matters as much as the EPS they print.""

Gilead CFO Dickinson stressed that the company wants to keep remdesivir ""both accessible and affordable to governments and patients around the world.""

Potential pricing models

Experts say it's important to start the conversation about a fair price for remdesivir now, before Gilead's donated supplies run out and ahead of any official approval.

The Institute for Economic and Clinical Review (ICER), an independent nonprofit research organization that analyzes and makes recommendations on fair drug pricing, released a report earlier this month on potential pricing models for remdesivir.

The report details several potential models for pricing remdesivir, which the organization said will be updated as more data becomes available.

The first model, a ""cost recovery"" approach, takes into account the marginal cost of producing additional doses of remdesivir, and the research and development costs put in by the company. The initial analysis sets the company's research and development costs at zero, because the drug was developed as a hepatitis C treatment prior to coronavirus.

That model sets the price of one, 10-day course of remdesivir for one Covid-19 patient at $10.

The second uses an analysis based on ""quality-adjusted life years"" gained by the drug, a model often used for drug pricing that considers how much a medication can lengthen and improve the quality of a person's life.

That model suggests that remdesivir be priced starting at $390 per 10-day course of treatment if the drug is ultimately found to have no mortality reduction benefits, and $4,460 per course of treatment if the drug is found to reduce mortality.

Even that highest price — nearly $4,500 per 10-day treatment — is fairly affordable compared to other, similar types of emergency intervention drugs that reduce mortality, said Van Buren, the Piper Sandler analyst, calling it ""one of the most reasonable price tags you can see on a drug with mortality benefits.""

For the most part, that amount also would not be paid by patients, but by insurance companies or government insurance programs.

The ICER study is not meant to lay out exact pricing for remdesivir, a decision that will ultimately be up to Gilead, ICER's vice president of communications and outreach David Whitrap said.

""What we're hoping to do is strike a conversation,"" Whitrap said. ""We think now is the time, before there is a price for this treatment, for the US and the pharmaceutical industry to think about how we want to incentivize and reward this sort of therapy, or any sort of therapy for Covid-19, in a way that accelerates drug development and is also affordable and accessible for patients."""
http://cnn.com,Coronavirus lockdown could give online education a lasting boost in India,"London (CNN Business) Schools around the world have closed their doors because of the coronavirus pandemic , leaving more than 1.5 billion children stuck at home. While it's a great inconvenience for many, it has created a spike in demand for online learning.

Educational institutions are introducing online courses and some education technology startups are temporarily offering free classes to help offset the impact of school closures.

Take Byju's, an India-based education startup named after its founder, Byju Raveendran. In early March, it announced it would give children free access to its learning app, which it says had more than 40 million users at the end of last year. Around 3 million of those paid between $150 and $200 for an annual subscription.

Since the announcement, the company says it has experienced a 60% surge in students using its products, which range from interactive video lessons and live classes, to quizzes and exam preparation.

""The outbreak is clearly increasing the appreciation of online education,"" Raveendran tells CNN Business. ""This could be a turning point for the industry, ushering in an increased usage of this format and changing habits in terms of how kids learn and how teachers teach,"" he adds.

Other Indian platforms, including Unacademy Vedantu and Toppr are also offering free classes and content to students.

Changing the learning habit

Google GOOGL and KPMG estimated in a 2017 report that India's online education market would be worth around $2 billion in 2021, up from $250 million in 2016, with the number of paying users rising to 9.6 million.

Those numbers may need significant revision. Raveendran thinks that the current school closures will not only boost online learning but will help to reset India's education system, with less emphasis on preparing for exams.

""Students just memorize, replicate and then forget when the exam is over,"" he says. Online learning would enable personalized lesson formats as well as a more engaging, interactive learning process.

Anantha Duraiappah is director of UNESCO's Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Education for Peace and Sustainable Development, which has a vision of ""transforming education for humanity.""

""It [online learning] allows the potential of individualized learning and offers the prospect of radically changing a system that frankly has not changed or evolved over the past 300-odd years,"" he tells CNN Business.

In 2017, the online learning market in India was projected to be worth around $2 billion by 2021.

A tool to democratize education?

That means education apps are no longer restricted to major urban centers or the wealthier members of society. Byju's says that more than 60% of its students are from outside the 10 largest cities in India.

The app is currently only available in Hindi and English, but Raveendran says Byju's is in the process of adding more regional languages.

Still, millions of children are unable to access online learning through a laptop or cell phone.

Raveendran accepts there is a long way to go. ""If you look at the total number of school students in India, our penetration is still a very small percentage,"" he says.

Byju's originally offered the free service until the end of April, but is likely to extend it, says Raveendran. He also hopes to create a free model for disadvantaged students in India for when schools reopen.

Although the free service will mean a short-term hit to revenue, Raveendran expects that in the long run it will be beneficial to the business.

""Once [pupils] start experiencing the advantages of learning online, we expect a lot of them to continue learning that way,"" he says."
http://cnn.com,There's a new entry in India's electric rickshaw race,"London (CNN Business) In India, electric rickshaws are increasingly seen as a way to cut air pollution.

Motorbikes and three-wheel rickshaws are ubiquitous in the country, and India's government announced last year that only electric two and three-wheel vehicles would be allowed by 2025.

Bangalore-based startup Altigreen is among the companies looking to fill this space, as it prepares to hit the market with its debut three wheeler.

Change from the bottom up

Altigreen, founded in 2012, started out retrofitting diesel and petrol cars with electric motors to convert them to hybrids.

The company will launch its first — as yet unnamed — fully electric vehicle ""within the next quarter,"" according to CEO Amitabh Saran.

JUST WATCHED India plans electric vehicle revolution Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH India plans electric vehicle revolution 01:52

A partner company is producing the car's external framework, while Altigreen supplies the internal components including motor, transmission, display system, and telematics that supply data on driving performance to the user's smartphone.

The startup is confident its model is among the fastest, with a top speed of 53 kilometers per hour (33 miles per hour), and offers faster charging, which is a key consideration for Altigreen's target market.

The company is ""focused on the bottom end of the market,"" says Saran, for customers driving passengers and cargo.

Rather than needing a charging station, Altigreen's three-wheeler can be charged through any ordinary AC power socket in three to four hours, the CEO says.

The vehicle has a higher initial price than non-electric rivals at around 350,000 rupees ($4,700) but Saran is confident it will deliver savings to drivers and fleet managers such as logistics companies.

""It is justified on pure economics,"" he says. ""Today a three-wheel driver spends 350-400 rupees ($4.70-$5.40) per day on diesel to cover 100 kilometers.""

""To do the same with our electric operation will be about 90 cents — a huge saving for someone who potentially earns $8-9 a day.""

Made in India

India's government has taken steps to incentivize the purchase of electric vehicles by cutting taxes and offering subsidies . Electric vehicles could mitigate the health impact of air pollution , although these vehicles would draw power from a grid largely reliant on coal, which is itself a polluter.

Other companies are also offering electric rickshaws, including Delhi-based Saarthi. Gayam Motor Works of Hyderabad has developed swappable batteries for its vehicles to avoid charging delays. Ride-hailing giant Ola has announced plans to put 1 million electric vehicles on India's streets, including 10,000 electric rickshaws

But Saran acknowledges that it will be challenging to win the trust of Indian motorists. He believes electric vehicles have a poor reputation due to an influx of cheap imports ill-suited to India's ""harsh environment"" of ""high temperatures, poor infrastructure, and potholes.""

Part of Altigreen's brand identity is that the company's products are almost entirely made in India, apart from a handful of components. Saran says they are tested in Indian conditions and designed for the country's unique challenges.

Altigreen is also looking to develop two and four-wheel vehicles. The company has a target of producing 10,000 vehicles a month within three years.

Like the rest of the world, India has been impacted by the spread of novel coronavirus. The whole country has been placed under lockdown for a minimum of 21 days in an effort to halt its spread.

But at the moment, Saran says the launch of Altigreen's electric three-wheeler remains on track. ""Fleet customers are continuing to ask us for vehicles,"" he says, but he acknowledges the lockdown could have an impact if it lasts beyond three weeks.

The potential for profit in the sector is huge, but Saran says the company is motivated by another ambition, to help the transition to clean fuel that could save many lives by cutting pollution.

""It drives my team knowing the target is greater than any commercial gain,"" he says."
http://cnn.com,"A few weeks ago, they were engineers, chefs and waitresses. Now they're farming","Kent, England (CNN Business) The British government wants you: To cut lettuce from the fields, pick berries from the bushes and load boxes of fresh produce into cold storage warehouses.

While many people hunker down at home, reloading the internet sites of grocery stores to secure a home delivery slot or dreading the socially distanced, masked visit to a supermarket, it's easy to lose sight of the supply chain and where that food is coming from.

As Covid-19 cases surpass 180,000 in the United Kingdom, British farmers are facing spring cut off from the Eastern European migrant workers that make the harvest possible. But with thousands of Brits laid off or furloughed, the UK government now says its official policy is to try to get locals onto the fields.

""We estimate that probably only about a third of the migrant labor that would normally come to the UK is here,"" George Eustice, the environment secretary and top British official on farming, said at press conference on Sunday. The government would work with farms to ""encourage those millions of furloughed workers to in some cases consider taking a second job, helping get the harvest in in June.""

Back to basics. The ""blitz spirit."" A nationwide effort to bind together wounds, not far off from the World War II campaign that carried the nation through the relentless German bombing campaign of 1940 and 1941.

Back breaking work

At the crack of dawn on a farm in Kent, southeast England on Monday, a group of six women are dressed in an idiosyncratic mix of T-shirts and down jackets. Bent double at the waist, they cut lettuce after lettuce from the earth, trimming leaves and then packing them onto pallets.

Farm director Nick Ottewell, affable and full of nervous energy, looks on.

McDonald's MCD Farming is complex enough in a normal year, he says. The pandemic has stranded his workforce and eliminated buyers like, which used to use his Apollo lettuce in its chicken wraps, when it still sold them.

Managing it all is ""virtually impossible."" He doubts the farm will even break even this year.

The Betts family own the farm here, land they've been tilling since the early 1900s. Ottewell reckons they're about 45 people short, and the clock is ticking. In two weeks, they have to harvest their most important crop: iceberg lettuce.

And yet without any advertising, the farm has gotten 50 unsolicited inquiries from locals seeking work, through word of mouth and stories in the Kent press.

Ottewell chose eight to come in for training. So on the last sunny day in a run of unusually fair English spring weather, a mix of young and old, male and female, gathered in an open-air conference room for a socially distanced induction.

'An honorable thing to do'

Daniel Martin, 32, sits in a kitchenette across from a female trainer with a laptop.

Until recently, he was a civil engineer, playing a crucial role in the British construction industry. Then came coronavirus, and he was furloughed.

Daniel Martin, 32, was furloughed from his civil engineering job.

""With construction sites closed, a lot of the clients have ceased work,"" he explains. ""So it dried up for us.""

His friend worked on the farm, and Martin figured driving a forklift would be better than sitting on his couch all summer.

""I just wanted to be active, to get involved. Keep me fit, get me out of the house, otherwise we're locked down at home. I enjoy being outside.""

Getting out and about: A running theme.

Nick Ottewell talks with Sally Penfold, 45, who says providing the nation with food is ""an honorable thing to do.""

""I was fed up with being indoors, not earning any money,"" said Sally Penfold, 45. ""I just wanted to get out there and do some kind of work. I think providing food for the nation is quite an honorable thing to do.""

She lost her waitress job at a restaurant in Hastings, after the UK government lockdown took effect at the end of March.

""I got a job in an Italian restaurant. And I worked there for about six weeks. And then the restaurant got closed down.""

She heard about the farm through a story on local radio, while staying with a friend, and decided that tending the land would be better than being ""stuck at home for weeks on end.""

Thomas Tanswell, 32, was laid off from his restaurant job. ""I needed to re-enter the world.""

Thomas Tanswell, 32, can relate.

He too lost his job, as a chef, to coronavirus.

""I decided basically I need to start getting active again,"" he explained. ""I could feel my mind maybe going a little bit. I decided I needed to reenter the world -- maybe take lemons to make lemonade, I guess.""

A love of the outdoors and a fear of idle hands made farm work an obvious option, Tanswell said.

""It just fits like a glove for me. Especially this time of year. So it might be something I'd be interested in long-term as well, to be honest. It seems like such a nice place and nice atmosphere.""

'Commit to us'

The enthusiasm was genuine, and yet Ottewell looked on with nervous hesitation.

Among his chief concerns is that the new recruits won't last, perhaps because they can't handle the hard work, get bored or go back to their old jobs. That could be disastrous, abandoning him and his crops mid-season.

The Alliance of Ethical Labour Providers, which helps provide farms with laborers, said that about 55,000 people have expressed interest in farm jobs. How many actually went on to accept a position? Just under 150, as of April 24, the alliance says.

Ottewell would love to have a bevy of Brits fill the 45 positions he has to fill before the all-important iceberg harvest. But he isn't hopeful.

""I've been working this industry my whole adult career, which is around 25 years now as a manager, and all of my experience tells me that that just isn't going to be the case,"" Ottewell said. He chafes at coverage in Britain's tabloid media. When a large lettuce grower in East Anglia chartered a plane to fly seasonal workers from Romania in mid-April, The Sun wrote that a UK company was paying for immigrants ""to show Brits how it's done.""

""It's seasonal work,"" Ottewell says. ""And British people haven't wanted to do seasonal work, for whatever reason.""

""Companies like ours have relied on migrant workers for decades to have businesses. However, we're here. And you're welcome to come. But come and commit to us for the summer."""

On Tuesday, Wendy's said some of its menu items might be ""temporarily limited at some restaurants"" because of the national meat shortage . Though its delivery schedule remains unchanged, supply has been tigh t because beef suppliers across North America face production challenges during the pandemic.

""The toughest part of it was that we were completely blindsided by it. I was already thinking about so many obstacles and mountains to climb for myself and for the founders that I was representing,"" Hamilton said. ""It did feel like the footing was just knocked from under us.""

Venture capital is more 'resilient than many may think'

While many businesses and startups have been hit hard by the pandemic, the venture capital industry has had more mixed results, she said.

""It's more resilient than many may think,"" Hamilton said. ""There are a lot of funds who, for one reason or another, were able to raise [money] right before this happened.""

According to data by PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association, 62 venture capital funds raised a total of $21 billion in the United States during the first quarter of 2020. This compares to a total of $51 billion raised for the full year of 2019, signaling that VC firms are in a stronger position to weather the impending economic downturn. And those figures don't include unspent capital. VCs in the United States started the year with roughly $120 million in available but unspent money to invest in startups, according to NVCA.

""There are more than 200 funds that I know of who are actively investing, and then there are those microfunds like ours, who if they already had trouble raising, this is going to compound that,"" Hamilton said.

Backstage Capital typically invests in 24 to 32 companies per year, but they've had to put investments on hold due to the pandemic, she said. The firm was even set to hit the road in May on a multi-city tour to connect with underrepresented founders, and make potential investments on the spot, but shelter-in-place mandates led to the tour's cancellation.

""The pause button has been hit for us,"" Hamilton said. ""We hope that in the second half of the year, we can pick back up.""

For now, Hamilton's firm is concentrating on ways it can add value and support to its portfolio companies during these unprecedented times.

""After we realized what had just happened to our world, we said, 'What can we do? What do we do now?,'"" Hamilton said.

The firm has been connecting founders with resources ranging from legal expertise to one-on-one support. ""Thankfully, we're remote by design, so that was easier to deal with. What we're doing is just doubling down on our services and our resources, and trying to add value in many other ways that are not capital intensive,"" she said.

'A great time to start a company'

Still, Hamilton believes there are opportunities out there for aspiring entrepreneurs.

""I think this is a great time to start a company, or to start something to be a solution to people,"" Hamilton said.

She also believes it's a smart time for entrepreneurs to practice bootstrapping and get creative in finding other ways to save capital. The result, she predicts, will be tomorrow's next big businesses.

""In a few years, you're going to see this emergence of many empires that are individuals who said, 'This is a time where I was stuck at home, or I was stuck in a situation that I don't want to ever have to be in again, and I am shoring myself up with multiple revenue streams. I'm getting creative. I'm going back to the basics,'"" Hamilton said.

As the coronavirus crisis continues, the economy has faced several fatal blows. So far, 33.5 million Americans, roughly 21% of the US labor force , has filed first-time unemployment claims since mid-March. Not to mention, US GDP growth contracted at an annualized rate of 4.8% in the first three months of 2020, its first contraction since 2008.

And while the economic collapse has taken a toll on many Americans' lives, minorities have fared the worst, with African-Americans impacted disproportionately higher in terms of health and finances.

According to a survey by Goldman Sachs published in late April, 40% of black small business owners reported that they have been approved for forgivable loans during the first round of the government's Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, compared with 52% of small businesses overall. Additionally, 26% of black business owners said they have less than one month of cash reserves on hand, compared with 17% of small business owners overall.

Despite these disparities, Hamilton remains optimistic that there will be more black millionaires and successful entrepreneurs in the years to come."
http://cnn.com,How to find a job in a pandemic,"(CNN) Editor's Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN's Work Transformed newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here .

The collapse of the job market came fast and furious.

It wasn't long ago when job seekers were in the driver's seat and enjoying multiple job offers. The labor market was so strong that some candidates weren't even showing up on their first day of work.

Times sure have changed. More than 33 million Americans have filed for initial unemployment benefits since mid-March. And a White House economic adviser recently warned that the jobless rate could spike to between 16% and 20% by June.

The whiplash we're all feeling is real.

Losing your job can be devastating. But mix in the greater economic uncertainty and a pandemic, and the search for a new job can seem overwhelming.

Update your resume. Be clear about what you can do for a company, and detail your accomplishments. Be specific about your past roles and responsibilities.

You also want to highlight your soft skills -- like communication and leadership experience -- as well as transferable skills if you are looking to get hired in a new industry.

Pay attention to the words and phrases used in the hiring company's job description and use them in your resume. Tailoring it for each job you apply for helps get you past resume filters.

Create a spreadsheet to track the jobs you've applied for along with the description. That way when a recruiter calls, you can easily reference how your skills apply to the job opening.

Enhance your repertoire. Take this time to learn new skills, take an online class or volunteer. Those experiences will not only help fill in any gaps on your resume, but they can also be good talking points during an interview to highlight your ambition and willingness to continue to grow professionally.

Learn to sell yourself. With so much in flux right now, employers want to see confidence and adaptability, one expert told me. Be prepared to share real-life examples that prove you are a team player ready to jump in and help navigate your organization through these uncertain times.

Ask for help. You never know where your next job lead will come from. It's difficult to network without face-to-face interactions. But you can call or email people and tell them you are looking for a job, provide details about your experience and what you are looking for to help hone in on worthwhile opportunities.

Former engineers get back to nature

Some job seekers are reinventing themselves during the pandemic. Unemployed workers in Britain, for example, are taking on a new role: farming.

British farmers are facing a shortage of workers to help with this season's harvest, so recently laid-off and furloughed locals are heading to the fields to help.

""I just wanted to be active, to get involved. Keep me fit, get me out of the house, otherwise we're locked down at home. I enjoy being outside,"" said a furloughed civil engineer.

The recovery's X factor: child care

In addition to getting the unemployed working again, another big step for the economic recovery will be to get people back into their offices.

But here's the reality: Working parents can't go back if they don't have child care.

Many parents have been juggling (some days it feels more like drowning in) professional and child care responsibilities. If daycare centers remain closed and summer camps don't happen, they are going to be left in the lurch if they get called back to work.

That means we could see parents making some tough decisions: Continue to work from home if they can, quit or decide not to get a new job if they were let go. All of these choices have an impact on the economy.

Read this story from CNN's Anneken Tappe about the knock-on effects of the lack of child care and how coronavirus could change the nature of work forever.

Protecting your credit during a pandemic

I know you've got a lot going on right now. But you need to be paying attention to your credit score.

These three digits can have a major impact on your finances, and what you do now can have long-lasting effects.

Even if you don't have any major purchases planned at the moment, you don't want to find yourself in a hole later on.

The first step is checking your credit early and often. And that's pretty easy now that the three major credit reporting agencies are offering free weekly credit reports for the next year.

Here are five tips from CNN's Anna Bahney to help protect your credit score during an economic crisis.

How data collectors are still doing their jobs from home

It's always fun to get an inside look at how people are making their jobs work when they can't be in the office.

Every month we get an important economic indicator: the jobs report. It calculates how many jobs were gained or lost in the previous month, as well as the unemployment rate. It can move stock markets and sway policy. And it takes thousands of government workers to produce.

So when the pandemic took hold in the US, the effort to transition these statisticians and data collectors to work remotely was a big undertaking.

Closets were raided to find equipment and there was a scramble to update software and find cell phones so people could continue to do their jobs during a time when reliable data is vital.

Coffee break

We could all use a little more zen these days, and what's more zen than planting your own garden?

Seed sales have increased during the pandemic as people test out their green thumbs. While there is a practicality to growing your own food, gardening can also bring a calming respite to the chaotic world around us.

And here's some good news: it's not too late to start one of your own."

http://cnn.com,Fear and a firing inside an Amazon warehouse,"(CNN Business) For nearly three years, Bashir Mohamed worked night shifts at an Amazon warehouse in Shakopee, Minnesota. As a ""stower"" at the facility, he was responsible for registering products into an inventory system before storing them on shelves for others to pick and pack. It was ""fairly stressful"" work, the 28 year old said, but he stuck with it in large part out of loyalty to his colleagues.

Like many at this particularfacility, Mohamed is of Somali descent. During his years at the warehouse, he played a central role in organizing for better protections for his colleagues. Mohamed, an avid news consumer, said he began voicing concerns in February about the threat coronavirus could pose to workers and later advocated for greater worker protections as the pandemic worsened in the United States.

Mohamed distributed paper petitions to workers in Somali and English and said he expressed concerns to management about what he called the impossibility of practicing social distancing in the facility. To his surprise, Mohamed said he was given a ""final warning"" in late March for allegedly not following the recommendation for six feet of social distancing while speaking to a colleague in the parking lot, an incident he said he asked for proof of but was not given. He was ultimately fired earlier this month for what Amazon claims, in a statement to CNN Business, was ""a result of progressive disciplinary action for inappropriate language, behavior, and violating social distancing guidelines.""

But Mohamed has a different view. ""They fired me to make others scared,"" he told CNN Business. ""I was the top target.""

Mohamed's firing, and the concerns expressed about it by several of his colleagues to CNN Business, highlight the tension between Amazon and its warehouse workers over safety and benefits during an unprecedented public health crisis. With their health potentially on the line, there has been renewed worker activism at a number of Amazon facilities during the pandemic -- and with it, claims by workers that Amazon is retaliating. Amazon denies those claims.

Mohamed and another worker at the facility were the second and third known employees at Amazon distribution facilities in the US who were fired earlier this month. In late March, Christian Smalls -- who led a protest outside Amazon's Staten Island facility over the company's response to coronavirus -- was the first to be terminated. (The company similarly said Smalls had ""received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines"" and was fired after attending a worker protest at the facility despite being under a 14-day quarantine.)

Bashir Mohamed, who was an employee at Amazon's Shakopee facility in Minnesota, was fired earlier this month. ""I was the top target,"" he claims.

In a statement about Mohamed's firing, and allegations of retaliation, Amazon spokesperson Kristen Kish told CNN Business the company has ""zero tolerance for retaliation against employees who raise concerns and respect the rights of employees to protest and recognize their legal right to do so; however, these rights do not provide blanket immunity against bad actions, particularly those that endanger the health, well-being or safety of their colleagues.""

The e-commerce giant has seen soaring demand for its products and services during the pandemic as people stay home and increasingly look to Amazon as a lifeline for household essentials. But it has also become the subject of increased scrutiny as warehouse workers express concerns about a range of issues — from crowded hiring events and training sessions to limited access to disinfectant wipes and the company's overall ability to follow through on its commitments.

There have been numerous cases of Amazon warehouse employees testing positive for coronavirus in the US and around the world. Amazon told CNN Business there have not been any confirmed cases at the Shakopee location to date.

Amazon, which has 400,000 employees across 110 fulfillment centers in North America, has not provided much information concerning the number of confirmed cases at its facilities. When asked on CNN last week , Amazon's top spokesperson Jay Carney said, ""I don't have a specific number.""

Inside Shakopee

Inside the Shakopee facility, the potential for confusion or miscommunication is particularly high, some workers said. Many are immigrants whose first language is not English. A large contingent, like Mohamed, are Somali or East African; Minnesota has the largest population of Somalis in the US, with nearly 49,000 Somali residents, according to a 2018 Economic Status of Minnesotans report.

To staff its Shakopee facility, which opened in 2016 and has over 1,000 employees, Amazon made a concerted effort to recruit East African immigrants, according to the New York Times

Roughly 80% of Somalis in Minnesota are living at or near poverty level , according to the same economic report. (Amazon declined to comment on the demographic breakdown of Shakopee facility workers.)

""The workforce in any given community reflects the community around it,"" Dania Rajendra, the director of the Athena , a coalition of organizations focused on confronting Amazon's growing power. ""Amazon's communications about its changing policies and about what to expect at work is uneven at best. When you add language barriers into an already failing communication mechanism, it just exacerbates all of those challenges.""

Mohamed, who commuted to the facility from where he lives in Minneapolis, about 40 minutes away, speaks English and Somali. He said he had been communicating with colleagues in the facility about coronavirus in English because his colleagues speak a mix of languages, including Spanish.

Some Shakopee workers told CNN Business about what they called a lack of clarity around new policies. In some cases, even those who do understand English well said they are having trouble keeping up with the pace of updates that come in various forms.

Sahro Sharif, an Amazon associate at Shakopee, said the company recently implemented rules on which stairs could be accessed to minimize contact with others. ""One you can only go up and the other you can only come down,"" said Sharif. ""I never even noticed the sign until someone said something to me.""

Amazon said it encourages employees to communicate concerns to management and that all facilities communicate policy updates in a variety of ways, including through on-site teams focused on educating employees about safety measures.

The company has instituted a number of changes at facilities across the country in response to the pandemic. That has included: staggering shift start times and break times to reduce congestion, temperature screenings at the beginning of shifts, and in recent days, requiring workers to wear masks provided by the company. The company said it has made over 150 process updates to date to ensure the health and safety of its employees.

Mohamed, and some of his coworkers, feel he was singled out for speaking up.

""It seems like what they're trying to say is if this warehouse is dangerous, it's dangerous because of the workers -- not because we have hundreds of workers coming in, touching surfaces or because we are bringing on hundreds of new hires and continuing to ship non-essential stuff,"" said William Stolz, an Amazon associate at the facility and friend of Mohamed's.

""At the same time, they've used some of their policies, and the ways they've applied them, to target certain people who have been involved in organizing or people who have had more disagreements with management,"" Stolz added.

A history of worker complaints and activism

Before coronavirus, Amazon had been criticized over safety concerns and treatment of its workers, including by some at the Shakopee facility. In 2018 and 2019, Minnesota workers, including those CNN Business spoke to for this article, helped lead protests against the company over issues including what they viewed as unrealistic productivity rates.

Employees from Amazon's Shakopee facility gather after worker action in March 2019. ""We don't want them to treat us as robots,"" Mohamed told CNN Business.

For some, like Hibaq Mohamed, another Somali immigrant who has worked as an Amazon associate for more than three and a half years at the Shakopee facility and has advocated for changes, getting coronavirus poses a risk not just to her health but also to that of her sister and her sister's two children, one of whom has severe asthma.

She called the warehouse conditions, which she said are crowded as the company continues to add new hires , ""unacceptable, scary and disappointing.""

The company is providing two weeks of paid leave for those who have confirmed cases of the coronavirus or are placed in quarantine. It is also offering unlimited unpaid time off. Amazon said it moved all new hire events and orientations to virtual platforms on March 23.

""They say, if you're worried about it to go home without pay. We're living paycheck to paycheck, that's impossible,"" Hibaq said. ""When we speak up, we receive what Bashir received. [Amazon is] not focusing on how to protect the community from this coronavirus spreading -- they focus on how to shut us up.""

Workers and organizations have filed complaints with the federal government to call attention to issues inside several warehouses across the country. Awood, a Minnesota-based nonprofit that advocates for East African workers, filed an Occupation Safety and Health Administration complaint in early April after an employee at the Shakopee facility was believed by their doctor to have coronavirus. In the complaint, Awood said the company needs to communicate this to workers, as well as close and clean the warehouse and ensure workers do not have to choose between their jobs and their health.

The company said it shares with employees when there is a confirmed case where they work.

Last Wednesday, Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar called for a federal investigation into the firing of Mohamed and the other employee at the facility. In her letter, she called the firings ""outrageous"" and said they were ""a clear violation of whistleblower protection provisions.""

""These accusations are simply unfounded,"" said Amazon's Kish. ""Nothing is more important than the safety of our teams. Since the early days of this situation, we have worked closely with health authorities to proactively respond, ensuring we continue to serve customers while taking care of our associates and teams.""

Meanwhile, Mohamed, who continues to consult with his now former colleagues about coronavirus through a WhatsApp group, said he plans to file for unemployment. ""My goal,"" he said, ""is to create a safe place."""

Follow her on Twitter . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

The adorable marsupial, rescued from a bush fire in Australia last week, died Tuesday . Caretakers made the decision to euthanize him after determining that the burns he sustained before being rescued by a woman (she named him ""Ellenborough Lewis"" after one of her grandchildren) were too extensive and, sadly, that it would be too painful for him to carry on.

When his rescue shot to viral fame, Lewis became a symbol of a much bigger problem: The plight of Australia's koalas as wildfires ravaged their natural habitat. Some outlets erroneously reported that koalas were ""functionally extinct"" as a result of a particularly early and particularly brutal fire season. They aren't extinct (under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, they are considered ""vulnerable to extinction"" ). But they are getting there, and we all need to be worried.

Indeed, koalas are a particularly cute emblem of how a perfect storm of greed, nationalism, climate denialism, political cynicism has gathered to fundamentally alter life on earth as we know it.

We are in the midst of a mass extinction. Under normal circumstances on Earth -- that is, pre-human history recorded in the fossil record -- the planet would lose between one and five species every year, according to the Center for Biological Diversity , an environmental advocacy group.

It's a thousand times that in the world today, courtesy of humans, scientists agree, and by the middle of the 21st century, half of all species could be obliterated.

Most of these species aren't as adorable as koalas or as magnificent as elephants. But they are crucial to their own ecosystems. As extinction accelerates, it dismantles those ecosystems -- our world, after all, is interdependent, and when you break crucial links in the chain, the downward effects on earthly life can be devastating.

That interdependency is precisely why koalas -- and so many other creatures -- are threatened in the first place.

In the US, President Donald Trump has abdicated the country's global leadership role on the climate crisis, pulling out of the Paris accords that would have at least made marginal efforts to reduce emissions and slow the rate of destruction. He has eased restrictions on polluters and opened the door for greedy oil and gas corporations to strip our lands of their valuable natural resources -- rather than aggressively pursuing renewable energy options that preserve our fragile environment.

The world's water and air don't recognize national borders. These decisions made by an American president and all world leaders that allow the planet to be plundered rather than preserved are devastating everywhere -- this week, to Lewis, and a huge number of other creatures that are less visible and less cute, but no less valuable.

Climate change is not just an American problem, but it is a disproportionate American responsibility. Our President promised to make America great again. Instead, he has ceded American responsibility and leadership.

http://cnn.com,A weak polar vortex will usher in record cold air as a nor'easter develops this weekend,"(CNN) A weak polar vortex will help usher in record cold air to the eastern half of the country this weekend. Significant snow could fall across interior New England as millions from Maine to the Gulf Coast will experience temperatures well below average.

An incredible weather pattern for early May is setting up, the National Weather Service in Caribou, Maine, said Thursday.

Record cold temperatures are setting the stage for a possible nor'easter Friday night into Saturday

""Over 100 million Americans will drop below freezing over the next few days,"" CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen says.

Friday evening and overnight, it will feel more like November than May, the National Weather Service said.

This is quite the seasonal whiplash effect.

Last weekend, Central Park in New York hit 80; this Saturday, they will struggle to hit 50. Their normal high-temperature this time of year is right in between these two extremes.

The main culprit for this unseasonable air is a storm system tracking across the upper half of the country.

""The unusually cold air mass from eastern Canada will be pulled southward down into the eastern US behind the storm,"" said the Weather Prediction Center. ""Resulting in widespread record low temperatures spanning as far south as Alabama and Mississippi on Saturday.""

The other is a weaker polar vortex.

Blame the polar vortex

The polar vortex was so strong this winter and spring it lead to the largest-ever Arctic ozone hole , but not big outbreaks of cold weather.

The polar vortex , as its scary name suggests, is a circulation of strong, upper-level winds that normally surround the northern pole, moving in a west to east direction -- a polar low-pressure system.

T

hese winds tend to keep the bitter cold air locked in the Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It's not a single storm. On occasion, this vortex can become distorted and dip much farther south than you would typically find it, allowing cold air to spill southward.

But it didn't spill out into the US this winter. That's why the spring and winter have been mild and major East Coast cities saw low snowfall amounts.

Now the polar vortex is weakening, allowing Arctic air to spill out -- leading to plunging temperatures in the East this weekend.

Significant snowfall for interior New England

Snow begins in the great lakes region Friday afternoon. By Friday evening and into the overnight, the snow will spread from the Central Appalachians to parts of the Northeast.

""It appears that interior New England will see a significant amount of wet snow with northerly wind becoming increasingly strong and gusty late Friday night into Saturday morning,"" the Weather Prediction Center says.

""Parts of New England could pick up 6 to 12 inches of snow,"" Hennen says

There is even a small -- 13% chance -- New York City could see snow showers early Saturday, the National Weather Service forecasts

Bottom line, this is an incredibly cold, deep and unusual trough for May.

Detroit, Indianapolis and Louisville, Kentucky, could potentially break records early Saturday, with low temperatures in the upper 20s to low 30s.

Snow will likely fall over portions of the Great Lakes into interior sections of the Northeast from Friday into Saturday, where some accumulation is likely.

""It appears that interior New England will see significant amounts of wet snow with northerly winds becoming increasingly strong and gusty late Friday night into Saturday morning,"" the Weather Prediction Center is forecasting."

(CNN) — Agrega otro bicho gigante a la lista de cosas que el estado de Washington está trabajando para controlar en este momento.

A principios de esta semana, los científicos dijeron que habían visto avispones gigantes asiáticos en el estado, y aún se desconoce cómo llegaron allí.

Ahora hay otra amenaza: una polilla gitana no nativa.

MIRA: Avispones gigantes invasores son vistos por primera vez en Estados Unidos

Es tal amenaza, de hecho, que el gobernador Jay Inslee emitió una proclamación de emergencia debido a las criaturas, diciendo que había un “peligro inminente de una infestación” de las plagas de plantas en partes del condado de Snohomish.

“Este peligro inminente de infestación pone en grave riesgo las industrias agrícolas y hortícolas del estado de Washington y amenaza seriamente el bienestar económico y la calidad de vida de los residentes del estado”, dijo la proclamación.

La amenaza es planteada tanto por las polillas gitanas asiáticas como por las polillas gitanas híbridas asiático-europeas, según la proclamación de emergencia.

Según una agencia gubernamental, las plagas pueden causar daños importantes.

“Según el Servicio de Inspección de Sanidad Animal y Vegetal del Departamento de Agricultura de los Estados Unidos,” las infestaciones grandes (de la polilla gitana asiática) pueden defoliar completamente los árboles”. “Esta defoliación puede debilitar severamente los árboles y arbustos, haciéndolos más susceptibles a las enfermedades. La defoliación repetida puede conducir a la muerte de grandes secciones de bosques, huertos y jardines”.

Las hembras pueden poner cientos de huevos, según la agencia, que se convierten en orugas y mastican más de 500 especies diferentes de árboles y arbustos.

Y debido a que las polillas pueden volar largas distancias, es probable que se propaguen rápidamente por todo el país, dijo la agencia."

(CNN) — El abuelo de Esron Torres fue ingresado en un hospital en Manaos, Brasil, con una herida en el dedo. Días después, fue enterrado en uno de los muchos cementerios superpoblados de la ciudad. Un puñado de familiares asistieron a la pequeña ceremonia, mientras que otros escucharon por teléfono mientras el patriarca de la familia descansaba.

Según su certificado de defunción, no fue la herida lo que lo mató, sino covid-19.

La tragedia destaca la crisis de salud masiva que enfrenta esta ciudad, la capital del estado noroccidental de Amazonas, y la tensión en la capacidad de las instituciones locales para contener el coronavirus.

Funcionarios han atribuido solo 532 muertes a covid-19 en Manaos, pero el total real es probablemente mucho mayor. Los datos de la ciudad muestran que 2.435 personas fueron enterradas solo en abril, en comparación con 871 entierros durante el mismo mes hace un año. También han surgido imágenes impactantes de excavadoras cavando fosas comunes en el cementerio de Parque Taruma, para enfrentar el repunte en los entierros.

El alcalde de Manaos, Arthur Virgilio Neto, le dijo a CNN Brasil que siente que la ciudad ha sido “abandonada” durante la crisis de salud. “Me gustaría crear conciencia en todo el mundo porque parece que no puedo lograr que Brasil despierte ante la importancia estratégica de mi estado y mi región”, dijo Neto.

MIRA: Brasil podría convertirse en el nuevo epicentro de la pandemia

Hospitales sobrepoblados

La pandemia ha dejado a muchos de los hospitales públicos de la ciudad sobrepoblados sin ningún lugar para tratar a los pacientes, dijeron los médicos en Manaos a CNN Brasil. También dijeron que el hacinamiento hacía difícil aislar a quienes presentaban síntomas de covid-19.

Torres dice que su abuelo de 69 años fue puesto en la misma habitación del hospital con al menos dos personas que parecían estar sufriendo síntomas de coronavirus, después de que su presión arterial se disparó durante un procedimiento quirúrgico menor.

Su certificado de defunción luego confirmó que había muerto por complicaciones de covid-19, según Torres. Aunque no fue examinado antes de la hospitalización, Torres dijo que su abuelo no había mostrado síntomas consistentes de coronavirus antes de ingresar al hospital y cree que contrajo el virus mientras estaba en cuidados intensivos.

Ahora, su principal preocupación es mantener a salvo a su abuela. “Mi abuela también es parte de este grupo de riesgo, por lo que ahora es nuestra principal preocupación”, dijo Esron.

Sandra, otra residente de Manaos, compartió una historia similar. CNN acordó usar solo su primer nombre debido a los detalles confidenciales que compartió.

Sentada afuera de un hospital público distinto, dijo que su madre había sido registrada después de sufrir un derrame cerebral. Cuando su madre comenzó a mostrar algunos síntomas consistentes con covid-19, la trasladaron a una habitación con personas que habían dado positivo por el virus.

“Ella está acostada allí rodeada de personas que padecen esa enfermedad de covid. Están todos mezclados en la sala de emergencias”, dijo Sandra, mientras gritaba fuera del hospital y luchaba contra las lágrimas. “Hay personas con el virus que están contaminando a otros”.

Las pruebas posteriores mostraron que había contraído coronavirus. Sandra cree que fue infectada mientras estaba hospitalizada, aunque esto no pudo ser confirmado por CNN.

MIRA: Muerte y desesperación por el coronavirus en Manaos, Brasil

“No hay reglas ni normas”

El Dr. Mário Vianna, presidente de la Unión de Doctores de Amazonas, dijo que las salas de maternidad de los hospitales se han convertido en áreas de alto riesgo para la propagación de las infecciones por coronavirus.

“Las salas de maternidad se convirtieron en una de las principales áreas de infección porque no hay un plan de aislamiento”, dijo Vianna a CNN Brasil. “No hay reglas o normas para el aislamiento”.

Vianna también dijo que los médicos están expuestos al coronavirus, debido a los bajos niveles de personal y la falta de equipos de protección personal (EPP), y que muchos van a trabajar por temor a morir o perder colegas.

“Se están perdiendo vidas debido a la incompetencia de varias autoridades”, dijo Vianna. “Culpo de la muerte de los profesionales de la salud al Gobierno, que no proporcionó ninguna protección. Es una situación criminal”.

El Ministerio de Salud no respondió a las preguntas de CNN sobre si los médicos estaban mal equipados para manejar la pandemia.

El propio Vianna dio positivo por coronavirus el 21 de abril, y el 1 de mayo apareció en un video en apoyo a otros trabajadores médicos desde una cama de hospital, con tubos de respiración en las fosas nasales.

MIRA: La emoción de un alcalde brasileño pidiéndole a Bolsonaro que tome precauciones por el covid-19

“Quédense en casa”

La gravedad de la pandemia no siempre ha sido reconocida públicamente por los principales líderes de Brasil.

El presidente Jair Bolsonaro, comparó el coronavirus con una “pequeña gripe”, presionó a los gobernadores y alcaldes para que levantaran las medidas de cuarentena con el fin de impulsar la economía y asistió a manifestaciones y protestas en Brasilia con multitudes de simpatizantes.

El martes, Bolsonaro predijo que los datos del Ministerio de Salud mostrarían que “lo peor había pasado”. En realidad, la cifra nacional de muertos anunciada más tarde ese día fue la más alta registrada hasta entonces. El miércoles volvió a subir.

El alcalde Neto dijo que cree que lo peor aún está por llegar y pronosticó que las infecciones podrían alcanzar su punto máximo en Manaos en mayo.

Manaos es conocido mundialmente como la puerta de entrada a la región de la selva amazónica y Neto ha pedido ayuda a los líderes mundiales y activistas climáticos, incluida Greta Thunberg. En un video publicado en su cuenta personal de Twitter, Neto le pidió a Thunberg que lo ayudara a crear conciencia sobre la situación en Manaos. Thunberg retuiteó una foto el 5 de mayo que muestra fosas comunes en Manaos a sus 4,1 millones de seguidores con el hashtag #SOSAMAZONIA.

Manaus is the epicenter of the COVID-19 in Amazonia.

El ministro de Salud, Nelson Teich, viajó a Manaos el lunes, donde visitó varios hospitales y se reunió con las autoridades locales, incluido Neto. El Ministerio de Salud dijo el lunes que contrató y trajo a 267 profesionales médicos para apoyar a los equipos de salud de la ciudad. El ministerio también proporcionó EPP adicional, incluidas máscaras N95, gafas y desinfectantes para manos.

Hasta la fecha, Brasil ha confirmado más de 125.000 casos de coronavirus y al menos 8.536 muertes. Al menos 9.243 de estos casos se han registrado en el estado de Amazonas, con más de la mitad de esos casos en Manaos, según los últimos datos publicados por la secretaria de Salud del estado.

http://cnn.com,Detenidos en presunta incursión marítima en Venezuela serán imputados este viernes,"Operación Gedeón: ¿qué salió mal? 7:40

(CNN Español) — El fiscal general de Venezuela, Tarek William Saab, anunció que los detenidos esta semana en una presunta incursión marítima, entre ellos dos estadounidenses, serán presentados en tribunales este viernes para ser imputados.

Saab informó, en una declaración televisada ante periodistas, que los ciudadanos venezolanos enfrentarán cargos de “conspiración con gobierno extranjero, terrorismo, traición a la patria, rebelión, tráfico ilícito de armas de guerra, financiamiento al terrorismo y asociación”.

Estas serían 5 fallas de la Operación Gedeón 1:45

Los extranjeros detenidos serán imputados por “terrorismo, conspiración, tráfico ilícito de armas de guerra y asociación”. Se trata de delitos que contemplan hasta 30 años de cárcel, la pena máxima en el Código Penal venezolano.

CNN está intentando determinar si los señalados han tenido acceso a sus posibles defensores, ya que las autoridades no han indicado si los detenidos cuentan con representación legal. Saab afirmó que en la audiencia se respetarán los derechos humanos.

Agregó el fiscal general que ya van 31 personas detenidas, sospechosas de haber participado en una operación de la que, según dice, el gobierno tenía conocimiento desde hacía tiempo y que tenía el objetivo de derrocar al cuestionado presidente Nicolás Maduro. También adelantó que solicitarán 22 nuevas órdenes de aprehensión por estos hechos y que ya se han practicado allanamientos

en cinco estados del país.

Por otra parte, Saab anunció que solicitarán órdenes de aprehensión y que pedirán, a través de Interpol, la extradición del estratega Juan José Rendón, así como también de Jordan Goudreau, director ejecutivo de la firma de seguridad estadounidense Silvercorp, a cargo de la fallida operación.

En una entrevista con CNN, Rendón, quien es asesor del presidente de la Asamblea Nacional de Venezuela, Juan Guaidó, dijo que firmó un acuerdo preliminar que no llegó a hacerse efectivo, con la idea de explorar si se podía capturar y entregar a la justicia a varios miembros del gobierno de Maduro que están procesados o que tienen órdenes de captura. Goudreau dijo en una entrevista a The Washington Post que los dos militares retirados estadounidenses que fueron capturados en Venezuela eran parte de la Operación Gedeón, una misión que su compañía organizó, para infiltrar el país y derrocar al presidente Nicolás Maduro.

J.J. Rendón dice que pagó US$ 50.000 a Silvercorp 1:05

Silvercorp no ha respondido a las solicitudes de comentarios hechas por CNN.

Guaidó, reconocido como presidente interino de Venezuela por más de 50 países, negó que hubiera estado involucrado en esta operación, como afirma el gobierno de Maduro. Las autoridades venezolanas también señalaron a Estados Unidos y Colombia de estar detrás de este supuesto complot, acusación que ambos países negaron.

Detienen a dos personas más

El ministro de Defensa de Venezuela Vladimir Padrino informó este viernes la captura de dos personas más, que se suman a las 23 que habían informado el día anterior en el marco de los operativos por un supuesto intento fallido de golpe de Estado al gobierno del cuestionado presidente Nicolás Maduro. Las nuevas detenciones se llevaron a cabo, según Padrino, en un sector montañoso al sur de Puerto Cruz, una ciudad costera en el estado La Guaira. “Y vamos por más”, escribió en un tuit."
http://cnn.com,"La tasa de desempleo de los hispanos en EE.UU. alcanzó un récord de 18,9%","EE.UU: estos son los grupos más afectados por el desempleo 1:48

(CNN Business) — La pandemia de coronavirus eliminó años de ganancias laborales para trabajadores negros e hispanos en el lapso de dos meses y provocó que la tasa de desempleo se disparara a niveles récord para casi todos los principales grupos de trabajadores.

LEE: La economía de Estados Unidos pierde un récord de 20,5 millones de empleos en abril

La tasa de desempleo de los estadounidenses negros se elevó a 16,7% en abril, casi el triple de la tasa en febrero y la más alta desde principios de 2010, según datos de la Oficina de Estadísticas Laborales publicados el viernes. La tasa de desempleo de los trabajadores hispanos alcanzó un récord de 18,9%, frente al 4,4% de hace dos meses.

Antes de la pandemia, las tasas de desempleo entre negros e hispanos habían caído a mínimos históricos.

Ahora, los trabajadores negros e hispanos son los más afectados por la pérdida de empleos provocada por el coronavirus, particularmente porque tienen más probabilidades de tener empleos con salarios más bajos y menos probabilidades de poder trabajar desde casa.

“Esta recesión es particularmente dura para las minorías y las mujeres dada su representación en las industrias más afectadas, desde ocio y hospitalidad, comercio minorista y atención médica”, dijo Diane Swonk, economista jefe de Grant Thornton.

Los trabajadores blancos vieron su tasa de desempleo saltar a un récord de 14,2%, más de cuatro veces mayor que en febrero. Los estadounidenses de origen asiático registraron una tasa de desempleo récord de 14,5%, casi seis veces mayor que hace dos meses.

La tasa de desempleo de las mujeres adultas se quintuplicó en abril al 15,5%, mientras que la tasa de hombres adultos casi se triplicó al 13%. Y la tasa de desempleo juvenil se triplicó entre febrero y abril a casi el 32%. Las tres fueron cifras récord.

La pandemia ha devastado el panorama laboral estadounidense. La mayoría de las principales industrias arrojan millones de puestos.

Casi la mitad de los trabajadores de restaurantes y hostelería perdieron sus empleos el mes pasado cuando el coronavirus provocó cierres radicales y restricciones de establecimientos de comida y bebida y hoteles.

El empleo en el ocio y la hospitalidad se desplomó en 7,7 millones, o el 47%. Casi las tres cuartas partes de la disminución tuvieron lugar en los servicios de alimentos y lugares para beber, pero también se perdieron empleos en artes, entretenimiento, recreación y alojamiento.

Los minoristas perdieron 2,1 millones de puestos. Especialmente afectados fueron las tiendas de ropa y accesorios, que perdieron 740.000 empleos.

La atención médica no fue inmune a la crisis, incluso cuando la pandemia llevó a muchos estadounidenses enfermos a buscar atención en los hospitales. El sector perdió 1,4 millones de empleos, particularmente en consultorios de dentistas y médicos, cuyos pacientes se quedaron en casa por temor a contraer o propagar el coronavirus. Más de 500.000 trabajos dentales desaparecieron el mes pasado.

Alrededor del 97% de los consultorios dentales en todo el país estaban cerrados por atención de rutina a fines de abril, y el 87% redujo parte o la totalidad de su personal, dijo Marko Vujicic, economista jefe de la Asociación Dental Americana. Muchos están reabriendo, pero el volumen de pacientes es solo un poco más de un cuarto de lo que era antes de la pandemia.

Los servicios profesionales y comerciales eliminan 2,1 millones de empleos, y los servicios de ayuda temporal se ven muy afectados. Y el empleo manufacturero se redujo en 1,3 millones.

Un punto positivo para destacar: los almacenes y los supercentros ganaron 93.000 empleos.

Aunque los estados están comenzando a reabrir, los economistas dicen que tomará tiempo para que las empresas reanuden sus operaciones, y que algunos nunca regresen.

“La realidad es que necesitas tener una economía lo suficientemente fuerte como para traerlos (empleos) de vuelta”, dijo Swonk. “En un mundo donde es muy difícil, no hay un momento de en sueño en el que construyas o abras (un negocio) y vayan a venir”."
http://cnn.com,Un virus tardó 4 meses en hacerle esto a EE.UU.,"Crédito: Photo/Paul Sancya

(CNN) — Cuando cada día se siente vagamente similar, puede ser difícil retraerse y observar la magnitud de lo que sucedió.

Lo que sucedió es que en menos de seis meses, más de 1,2 millones de estadounidenses se han infectado con una enfermedad y más de 75.000 han muerto.

Pero esa es sólo la mitad de la historia.

También existe el torniquete de distancia social, que tiene famélica a la economía de Estados Unidos y llevó a más de 33 millones de estadounidenses, el 10% de toda la población del país y cerca del 20% de su fuerza laboral, a solicitar auxilio por desempleo en menos de dos meses.

El viernes, la Oficina de Estadísticas Laborales (BLS, por sus siglas en inglés) informó que en EE.UU. se perdieron 20,5 millones de empleos en abril, el mayor mes de pérdidas de empleos desde que comenzó el seguimiento en 1939. La tasa de desempleo ahora es del 14,7%, la más alta desde que BLS comenzó a registrar la tasa mensual en 1948. La última vez que el desempleo estadounidense fue tan grave ocurrió durante la Gran Depresión: la tasa de desempleo alcanzó el 24.9% en 1933, según estimaciones históricas anuales del BLS.

Todo ha sucedido muy rápido.

Se descubre el covid-19. El gobierno chino confirmó la nueva enfermedad el 7 de enero.

El primer caso conocido en territorio estadounidense se confirmó el 21 de enero, 10 días antes de que la administración de Trump anunciara que negaría la entrada a Estados Unidos a ciudadanos extranjeros que habían viajado recientemente a China.

Una mujer de 57 años en California se convirtió en la primera víctima en suelo estadounidense. No había viajado recientemente a Europa. La enfermedad estaba aquí, pero no sabíamos el alcance de la misma. Sin embargo, los brotes en cruceros, la propagación a Asia y la cuarentena de ciudades en Italia deberían haber sido advertencias.

El Dow alcanza un máximo histórico el 12 de febrero. El presidente Donald Trump reaccionó a las críticas de una respuesta lenta al virus y puso al vicepresidente Mike Pence a cargo de un nuevo grupo de trabajo. Los mercados comienzan a sacudirse.

TASA DE DESEMPLEO DE FEBRERO – 3,5%

INFECCIONES CONOCIDAS EN EE.UU. – 102

MUERTES CONOCIDAS EN EE.UU. – 6

En la semana que terminó el 14 de marzo, un número relativamente normal de 282.000 estadounidenses solicitaron beneficios de desempleo por primera vez.

Comienza el confinamiento. Una semana después, la mayoría de las escuelas de EE.UU. habían cerrado sus puertas, a todos los que podían evitar ir a trabajar se les dijo que se quedaran en casa y la nueva realidad de covid-19 había cerrado gran parte de Estados Unidos.

Millones pierden empleos. En la semana que terminó el 21 de marzo, 3,3 millones de estadounidenses solicitaron beneficios por primera vez, una cifra asombrosa que se duplicó con creces una semana después.

Para cuando comenzó abril, más de 10 millones de estadounidenses habían presentado una nueva solicitud de desempleo.

El gobierno trata de ayudar. El Congreso aprobó y Trump firmó dos paquetes de estímulo separados que designaron billones de dólares para ayudar a los estadounidenses sin trabajo y a las empresas perjudicadas. Pero no es suficiente.

El virus explota. Las infecciones pasaron de aproximadamente 100 a decenas de miles en un mes, y las muertes se multiplicaron.

ABRIL 1 DE 2020, EL DOW CERRÓ EN – 20.943

TASA DE DESEMPLEO DE MARZO – 4,4%

MUERTES CONOCIDAS EN EE.UU. – Más de 4.780

SOLICITUDES DE DESEMPLEO POR PRIMERA VEZ – Más de 10 millones en marzo

El mercado se estabiliza, pero muchos millones más están desempleados. La infección continuó multiplicándose y multiplicándose. Otros 20 millones de estadounidenses solicitaron un nuevo auxilio de desempleo durante el mes.

Aumenta el número de muertos. Fallecieron más personas por coronavirus en EE.UU. en varios meses que el número de estadounidenses durante la guerra de más de una década en Vietnam.

El virus no se reduce. A pesar de que la curva de infecciones no había disminuido en la mayoría de EE.UU., una reacción violenta al distanciamiento social llevó a los gobernadores a avanzar hacia la reapertura de partes del país.

MAYO 7 DE 2020, EL DOW CERRÓ EN – 23.976

MUERTES CONOCIDAS EN EE.UU. – Más de 75.000

SOLICITUDES DE DESEMPLEO POR PRIMERA VEZ – Más de 20 millones en abril

Analistas pronostican una tasa de desempleo entre 10% y 22% cuando se publiquen nuevos datos de desempleo el viernes. Pero eso todavía no tendrá en cuenta casi 10 millones de nuevas solicitudes de desempleo en la segunda mitad de abril, como se reflejó anteriormente.

A medida que los estados comienzan a reabrir sus economías a pesar de que el virus continúa creciendo en nuevos puntos críticos fuera de los centros urbanos, está claro que las infecciones reportadas están por debajo del verdadero número de contagios.

Y lo que cambió la sociedad tan rápidamente en unos pocos meses ahora parece que llevará años arreglarlo.

El paro está afectando a los grandes almacenes asequibles como JC Penney, además de los minoristas exclusivos J. Crew y Neiman Marcus, que se han declarado en bancarrota.

Se detuvo en gran medida el sector de restaurantes, los viajes y el turismo.

El virus también destapó algunas realidades incómodas de la sociedad estadounidense. Un impulsor de la recesión es la pérdida del gasto en atención médica. La interrupción de los procedimientos electivos y las visitas al hospital ha perjudicado a los proveedores de atención médica, enfermeras y médicos estadounidenses cuando los ciudadanos necesitan más atención médica.

Cómo ver estos datos horribles: ¿Es hora de comparar esto con la Gran Depresión?

El mes pasado le formulé a David Wessel, director del Centro Hutchins sobre Política Fiscal y Monetaria de la Institución Brookings, una serie de preguntas sobre cómo ver esta información económica increíblemente sombría.

Desde entonces, las cosas han empeorado mucho.

Decenas de millones de estadounidenses han presentado nuevos reclamos de desempleo.

El Congreso está discutiendo sobre un cuarto paquete de estímulo.

Varios estados están comenzando a reabrir a pesar de que no han cumplido con las pautas de la Casa Blanca para contener el virus.

Así que volví a Wessel para una actualización. Su nueva preocupación por una transición presidencial no es algo que yo haya considerado.

ZW: ¿Cómo transformó el mes pasado su evaluación de lo que está sucediendo?

DW: En el último mes, me di cuenta de cuánto tiempo le tomará a la economía recuperarse. Sabemos que el segundo trimestre será horrible, pero no estoy seguro de cuán grande será el rebote en el tercer trimestre: ¿qué tan gradualmente terminarán los cierres? ¿Las personas estarán reacias a comprar y viajar en el metro? ¿El virus disminuirá y luego regresará? Esto va a ser un largo recorrido.

ZW: Hace un mes estabas optimista de que el gobierno estaba trabajando rápidamente para hacer lo que pudiera por la economía. ¿Todavía se siente de esa manera?

DW: El gobierno actuó rápidamente, pero ahora el Congreso parece haber regresado al estancamiento partidista que amenaza con retrasar, entre otras cosas, la ayuda que el gobierno estatal y local necesitan desesperadamente para evitar despedir trabajadores y restringir los servicios públicos.

ZW: ¿En qué momento es apropiado comenzar a comparar esto con la Gran Depresión?

DW: Las comparaciones son útiles, pero requieren perspectiva.

La profundidad de la recesión rivalizará con los peores trimestres de la Gran Depresión. Pero la combinación de medidas sensatas de salud pública y políticas fiscales y monetarias prudentes puede acelerar y fortalecer la recuperación. No tenemos que revivir la década de 1930 y con buenas políticas no tendremos que hacerlo.

Tengo una nueva preocupación. La transición de Hoover a Roosevelt después de la [elección] de 1932 fue mala. El día de la inauguración no llegó hasta marzo en ese entonces, y las cosas se pusieron realmente mal entre noviembre de 1932 y marzo de 1933. Si Joe Biden gana las elecciones de noviembre de 2020, espero que la transición de un presidente a otro no empeore las cosas más de lo que está.

¿Cómo fue realmente la Gran Depresión?

John Blake de CNN fue a la historia oral definitiva de la Gran Depresión, compilada por Studs Terkel, y ha reimpreso parte de ella.

El placer era una libra de hamburguesa: Robert Card dijo que salió a la universidad con un traje, una corbata, un par de zapatos y US$ 30 prestados de un banco. Llamó a la Depresión un momento “doloroso” pero “glorioso” porque obligó a Estados Unidos a enfrentar problemas de pobreza de larga data.

Era un placer comprar una libra de hamburguesa, que comprabas por unos cinco centavos, llevarla a las vías del ferrocarril Union Pacific y comer al aire libre. Tener una excelente conversación. Y tal vez nadar en el río Kaw.

Un amigo mío tenía un viejo Ford sedán modelo T, de 1919. Tenía esta cosa acondicionada como una casa. Vivió en él todo el año. Cocinó, durmió y estudió dentro de ese Ford sedán modelo T. Cómo se las arregló nunca lo sabré. Una vez fui a cenar allí. Cocinó muy bien en una pequeña estufa que tenía en esta cosa.

Peor desde 1706

A nivel local el tamaño y la escala de este golpe, el Banco de Inglaterra ha dicho que el Reino Unido se dirige a su peor impacto económico por el producto interno bruto desde 1706. No estoy exactamente seguro de cómo se compara esta economía con esa, pero en términos de PIB, esto se ve peor que:

Las guerras napoleónicas

La Revolución Americana

La Gran Depresión

Ambas Guerras Mundiales

“Es una mujer joven y maravillosa, Katie, dio muy buenos resultados durante un largo período de tiempo y, de repente, hoy dio positivo”, dijo Trump.

Trump nunca usó el apellido de Miller en sus comentarios, pero luego confirmó que era “una persona de la prensa”.

El presidente dijo que Miller no ha entrado en contacto con él, pero señaló que ella ha estado en contacto con Pence.

(CNN) — Los Simpson siguen con su racha de ser el Nostradamus de nuestra cultura pop.

La serie animada de larga duración de Fox, que es de hecho la más larga de la historia, tiene un episodio de 1993 que parece presagiar el 2020 con la pandemia y los “avispones asesinos”.

El episodio titulado “Marge in Chains”, de la temporada 4, presenta a un trabajador asiático enfermo que estornuda en un envío de exprimidores que muchos de los residentes de Springfield desean comprar, lo que inicia un brote de la “gripe de Osaka”.

A medida que las personas entran en pánico, derriban un camión que creen que tiene la cura, pero en su lugar derriban una caja marcada como “Killer Bees” (abejas asesinas) y desatan un enjambre.

A principios de esta semana, los científicos dijeron que habían visto avispones gigantes asiáticos, también conocidos como avispones asesinos, en el estado de Washington, y aún se desconoce cómo llegaron allí. El avispón más grande del mundo puede matar a un humano con solo picar unas pocas veces.

Uno de los escritores del episodio, Bill Oakley, inicialmente le dijo a The Hollywood Reporter en marzo que no le gustaba que Internet señalara el episodio como un predictor de la pandemia: “No me gusta que se use con fines nefastos”.

“La idea de que alguien se apropie de la manera incorrecta para hacer que el coronavirus parezca un complot asiático, es terrible”, dijo Oakley. “En términos de intentar culpar a Asia, creo que eso es asqueroso”.

Pero el miércoles el escritor admitió las similitudes y tuiteó: “está bien, supongo que lo hicimos” en respuesta a otro usuario de Twitter que dijo que el programa predijo lo que está ocurriendo en 2020.

Aquí hay algunos otros ejemplos de las miradas precisas que el programa ha hecho al futuro:

Elección de Trump como presidente

En el año 2000, el programa tuvo un episodio titulado “Bart to the Future” en el que bromeó sobre la hermana de Bart, Lisa, que se convirtió en presidente después de la presidencia de Trump, pero reportes dicen que la imagen que muestra la predicción mostrando una imagen de Trump en una escalera mecánica y predijo que el mapa electoral de su victoria resultó ser falso.

El ataque de un tigre a Siegfried & Roy

Siegfried Fischbacher y Roy Horn, los famosos artistas de Las Vegas que trabajan con grandes felinos, fueron parodiados por el programa en 1993.

En el episodio, un tigre blanco ataca a “Gunter y Ernst” durante su actuación como venganza por haber sido arrebatado de la vida en la naturaleza.

En la vida real, Horn sufrió una lesión que puso fin a su carrera en 2003 después de que un tigre lo atacara durante un espectáculo.

Disney comprando 21st Century Fox

El programa parecía hacer una predicción comercial 20 años antes de que sucediera.

Un episodio titulado “When You Dish Upon A Star”, emitido por primera vez en 1998, incluyó un letrero en el frente de un edificio que decía “20th Century Fox, una división de Walt Disney Co”.

En 2017, Disney anunció que estaba comprando una gran parte de 21st Century Fox, propiedad de 20th Century Fox, y luego el reportero de ESPN, Darren Rovell, tuiteó una foto del letrero del episodio de “Los Simpson”.

“Disney anuncia que ha llegado a un acuerdo para adquirir 21st Century Fox, como lo predijo un episodio de Los Simpson que se emitió por primera vez el 8 de noviembre de 1998”, escribió.

http://cnn.com,"Las ratas están infectando a los humanos con hepatitis, y nadie sabe cómo","(CNN) — En 2018, expertos en enfermedades infecciosas de la Universidad de Hong Kong se encontraron con un paciente inusual.



El hombre de 56 años, que se había sometido a un trasplante de hígado, mostraba funciones hepáticas anormales sin causa aparente.

Las pruebas encontraron que su sistema inmunitario estaba respondiendo a la hepatitis E, pero en realidad no pudieron encontrar la cepa humana del virus de la hepatitis E (HEV) en su sangre.

MIRA: Polillas gitanas: el estado de Washington ahora tiene otro bicho por el cual preocuparse (tras los avispones gigantes)

La hepatitis E es una enfermedad hepática que también puede causar fiebre, ictericia y un agrandamiento del hígado. El virus viene en cuatro especies, que circulan en diferentes animales; en ese momento, se sabía que solo uno de estos cuatro infectaba a los humanos.

Con las pruebas para esa cepa humana de HEV negativa, los investigadores rediseñaron la prueba de diagnóstico, la ejecutaron nuevamente y descubrieron, por primera vez en la historia, la hepatitis E de rata en un humano.

“De repente, tenemos un virus que puede saltar de las ratas callejeras a los humanos”, dijo el Dr. Siddharth Sridhar, un microbiólogo y uno de los investigadores de HKU que hizo el descubrimiento. Fue una infección tan inusual y sin precedentes que el equipo se preguntó si se trataba de un “incidente único, un paciente que estaba en el lugar equivocado en el momento equivocado”.

Pero luego sucedió de nuevo. Y otra vez.

Desde ese primer estudio, 10 residentes más de Hong Kong han dado positivo con hepatitis E de rata, también conocida como HEV de rata. El caso más reciente llegó hace una semana; un hombre de 61 años con función hepática anormal dio positivo el 30 de abril. Y podría haber cientos más de personas no diagnosticadas infectadas, dijo Sridhar.

La cepa humana de la hepatitis E generalmente se transmite a través de la contaminación fecal del agua potable, según la Organización Mundial de la Salud.

Pero la cepa de la rata plantea un nuevo misterio: nadie sabe exactamente cómo se están infectando estas personas. En los dos años transcurridos desde el descubrimiento, los investigadores aún no han identificado la ruta exacta de transmisión de las ratas a los humanos. Tienen teorías, tal vez los pacientes bebieron agua contaminada como la cepa humana habitual, o manipularon objetos contaminados, pero nada ha sido probado definitivamente.

El paciente reciente de 61 años tiene a la autoridades particularmente perplejas; no había ratas ni excrementos de ratas en su hogar, nadie más en su hogar ha mostrado síntomas y no tiene antecedentes de viajes recientes.

“Según la información epidemiológica disponible, no se pudo determinar la fuente y la ruta de la infección”, dijo el Centro de Protección de la Salud (CHP) de Hong Kong en un comunicado el 30 de abril. El hombre todavía está en el hospital y la investigación del CHP está en marcha.

Lo que sabemos y lo que no sabemos

El equipo de investigación y las autoridades de la ciudad han tratado de comprender mejor esta nueva amenaza para la salud desde 2018.

Han hecho algunos progresos. Sus pruebas de diagnóstico han sido refinadas y mejoradas. Han difundido la conciencia entre el sector de la atención médica para que los médicos sepan que deben realizar pruebas de detección del virus de la hepatitis C y lanzaron campañas de sensibilización pública.

Los científicos están haciendo pruebas en poblaciones de ratas en toda la ciudad para tratar de identificar grupos antes de que puedan saltar a los humanos, lo que ha proporcionado datos sobre cuántos roedores en la ciudad portan HEV de ratas y qué áreas tienen la mayor cantidad de ratas.

Pero todavía hay muchas cosas que aún se desconocen. No saben cuánto tiempo dura el período de incubación de este virus, es decir, cuánto tiempo tardan los pacientes en enfermarse después de la exposición. Todavía están tratando de encontrar un tratamiento, ya que el medicamento utilizado para tratar la variante humana de la hepatitis E ha tenido resultados mixtos en pacientes con HEV de rata.

Y, por supuesto, la mayor incógnita que sigue molestando a los científicos es el cómo.

No saber cómo el virus salta de las ratas a los humanos hace que sea muy difícil prevenir nuevas infecciones, o incluso dar sentido a todos los datos que los investigadores han recopilado. Por ejemplo, las personas que viven en áreas infestadas de ratas en teoría deberían estar en mayor riesgo, sin embargo, algunos pacientes infectados provienen de vecindarios con un bajo número de ratas.

“Lo que sabemos es que las ratas en Hong Kong son portadoras del virus, y evaluamos a los humanos y encontramos el virus. Pero cómo exactamente salta entre ellos, ya sea que las ratas contaminen nuestros alimentos o haya otro animal involucrado, no lo sabemos”, dijo Sridhar. “Ese es el eslabón perdido”.

Una solución podría ser deshacerse de todas las ratas en Hong Kong, pero la erradicación de ratas es una hazaña larga y complicada que no es muy factible. Sería necesario reducir los lugares donde pueden refugiarse, así como su acceso a los alimentos, con medidas como evitar que se descarten alimentos en callejones traseros.

Por ahora, todo lo que las autoridades pueden hacer es instar a las personas a tomar medidas preventivas, como lavarse las manos antes de comer, almacenar los alimentos adecuadamente o en el refrigerador, y mantener la casa limpia y desinfectada con lugares mínimos de anidación para roedores.

Esto podría estar sucediendo en todas partes

Es probable que esto no sea solo un problema de Hong Kong, o incluso uno reciente, dicen los expertos. El HEV de rata podría estar infectando a personas en Nueva York o París, y simplemente no lo sabemos, porque nadie lo está probando.”Mi sensación es que esto ha estado sucediendo durante mucho tiempo”, dijo Sridhar. “2017, 2018 definitivamente no es la primera vez que sucede en el mundo”.

En Hong Kong, los 11 casos confirmados probablemente sean solo la punta del iceberg, agregó. Los médicos pudieron examinarlos para detectar HEV en ratas porque buscaron atención médica para detectar síntomas o estaban recibiendo chequeos debido a afecciones o trasplantes preexistentes.

Pero puede haber cientos de casos infectados en la comunidad, que no entran en estas categorías y no han sido diagnosticados, dijo.

Muchas personas con hepatitis E solo experimentan síntomas leves y, en algunos casos, ni siquiera saben que están infectadas o no van al hospital.

Pero el virus puede tener serias consecuencias para la salud, particularmente para pacientes con inmunidad debilitada. Las personas jóvenes y sanas sin afecciones preexistentes pueden recuperarse por sí solas, pero para poblaciones vulnerables, podría causar hepatitis crónica que los pacientes no pueden evitar, así como daño hepático a largo plazo y cicatrización de tejidos.

Además de los 11 casos en Hong Kong, solo otro caso ha sido confirmado a nivel mundial: un hombre en Canadá que había viajado previamente a África. Fue al hospital después de experimentar urticaria, náuseas, ictericia grave y un hígado inflamado, y dio positivo por HEV de rata, según un informe publicado en febrero de 2019.

La única razón por la cual las autoridades detectaron este caso fue porque usaron un tipo amplio de prueba que detecta muchas hebras del virus de la hepatitis E, dijeron los investigadores en el informe, que se publicó en el Journal of Infectious Diseases. De lo contrario, “el diagnóstico podría haberse perdido”, dijo el informe.

Este es el problema: la mayoría de los países no están haciendo pruebas para detectar el VHE en ratas, por lo que es muy probable que solo les falten diagnósticos, dijo Sridhar.

MIRA: Usan drones agrícolas para desinfectar el transporte público

Se necesita una prueba especializada, como la diseñada por HKU, para buscar específicamente HEV de rata en humanos. No es una prueba difícil de hacer, pero no se ha adoptado ampliamente porque nadie pensó hasta hace poco que el HEV de rata era incluso una amenaza para los humanos.

Por ejemplo, en Europa, “la falta de conciencia de los médicos y los diagnósticos mal estandarizados llevaron a la falta de información” en los casos de hepatitis E, dijeron Cornelia Adlhoch del Centro Europeo para la Prevención y el Control de Enfermedades (ECDC) y Sally Baylis del alemán Paul-Ehrlich- Institut, en una carta publicada este marzo en la revista Hepatology.

Solo el año pasado el ECDC finalmente desarrolló pautas sobre cómo recopilar datos e informar sobre la hepatitis E, decía la carta, pero estas nuevas pautas se centraron en la variante humana y no incluyeron HEV de ratas, dejando lo que Sridhar llama “ciego” lugar en nuestros diagnósticos “.

Este punto ciego y la posibilidad de que el virus infecte a las personas a nivel mundial sin ninguna medida de control, pone en riesgo a algunas de las personas más vulnerables de la sociedad: las personas mayores, las comunidades afectadas por el VIH, las personas con afecciones preexistentes y más.

“Esto no debería estar sucediendo”, dijo Sridhar. “Necesitamos vigilancia continua en el público para controlar esta infección inusual. Realmente espero que las autoridades de salud pública den el primer paso y observen cuánto están realmente expuestas sus poblaciones a la hepatitis E de la rata”."
http://cnn.com,"Coronavirus en semen de hombres, el nuevo hallazgo de investigadores chinos","Dr. Huerta: ""Este virus ha llegado para quedarse"" 3:15

(CNN) — El nuevo coronavirus puede persistir en el semen de los hombres incluso después de que hayan comenzado a recuperarse, un hallazgo que aumenta la posibilidad de que el virus se transmita sexualmente, según dijeron el jueves investigadores chinos.

Un equipo del Hospital Municipal de Shangqiu examinó a 38 pacientes varones tratados allí en el momento álgido de la pandemia en China, en enero y febrero.

Alrededor del 16% de ellos tenían evidencia del coronavirus en su semen, informó el equipo en la revista JAMA Network Open. Alrededor de una cuarta parte de ellos estaban en la etapa aguda de infección y casi el 9% de ellos se estaban recuperando, informó el equipo.

“Descubrimos que el SARS-CoV-2 puede estar presente en el semen de pacientes con covid-19, y el SARS-CoV-2 aún puede detectarse en el semen de pacientes en recuperación”, escribió Diangeng Li, del Hospital General del Ejército Popular de Liberación de China en Beijing, y sus colegas.

“Incluso si el virus no puede replicarse en el sistema reproductor masculino, puede persistir, posiblemente como resultado de la inmunidad privilegiada de los testículos”, agregó el equipo. La inmunidad privilegiada significa que el sistema inmunitario no puede alcanzar completamente la región para atacar a los invasores virales.

LEE: Los cazadores de virus que buscan cuevas de murciélagos para predecir la próxima pandemia

No es un hallazgo sorprendente. Muchos virus pueden vivir en el tracto reproductor masculino. Se descubrió que el virus del ébola y el zika se diseminó en el semen a veces meses después de que un paciente masculino se había recuperado.

Todavía no está claro si el coronavirus puede propagarse de esta manera. Encontrar evidencia de virus no significa necesariamente que sea infeccioso.

“Si se pudiera demostrar que el SARS-CoV-2 puede transmitirse sexualmente en futuros estudios, la transmisión sexual podría ser una parte crítica de la prevención de la transmisión”, escribió el equipo.

“La abstinencia o el uso del condón pueden considerarse como medios preventivos para estos pacientes. Además, vale la pena señalar que es necesario realizar estudios para monitorear el desarrollo fetal. Por lo tanto, evitar el contacto con la saliva y la sangre del paciente puede no ser suficiente, ya que la supervivencia del SARS-CoV-2 en el semen de un paciente en recuperación mantiene la probabilidad de infectar a otros”."

http://cnn.com,Un vórtice polar débil llevará un récord de bajas temperaturas a Estados Unidos,"(CNN) – Un vórtice polar débil abrirá el paso para bajas temperaturas récord en la mitad oriental de Estados Unidos este fin de semana. Cantidades considerables de nieve podrían caer en el interior de Nueva Inglaterra, mientras millones desde Maine hasta la costa del Golfo de México experimentan temperaturas muy por debajo del promedio.

Un patrón climático increíble para principios de mayo se está estableciendo, informó este jueves el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional en Caribou, Maine.

Se espera que las frías temperaturas récord comiencen entre la noche de este viernes (que no será para nada primaveral) y el sábado.

“Para más de 100 millones de estadounidenses las temperaturas caerán por debajo de 0 durante los próximos días”, señaló Dave Hennen, meteorólogo de CNN.

La noche de este viernes y la madrugada del sábado se sentirán más como noviembre que mayo, advirtió el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional.

Se trata de un efecto de latigazo estacional.

El fin de semana pasado, Central Park en Nueva York alcanzó los 26,6 grados Celsius (80 grados Fahrenheit), pero este sábado tendrá dificultades para llegar apenas a los 10 grados Celsius (50 grados Fahrenheit). Su temperatura máxima normal durante esta época del año se encuentra justo entre esos dos extremos.

El principal culpable de este tiempo no estacional es un sistema de tormenta que afecta a la mitad superior del país.

“La masa de aire inusualmente frío que proviene del este de Canadá será arrastrada hacia el sur con dirección al este de Estados Unidos, detrás de la tormenta”, indicó el Centro de Predicción del Clima. “Lo que resultará en bajas temperaturas récord, que de manera generalizada se extenderán hasta el sur de Alabama y Mississippi este sábado”.

El otro responsable de la situación es un vórtice polar más débil

Puedes culpar al vórtice polar

El vórtice polar fue tan fuerte durante este invierno y primavera que llevó al agujero de ozono en el Ártico más grande de la historia, pero no produjo grandes brotes de clima frío.

El vórtice polar, como su temible nombre lo indica, es una circulación de vientos fuertes de nivel superior que normalmente rodean el Polo Norte, moviéndose en dirección oeste-este, es decir, un sistema polar de baja presión.

Estos vientos tienden a mantener el aire frío encerrado en las regiones árticas del hemisferio norte. No es una sola tormenta. En ocasiones, este vórtice puede distorsionarse y llegar mucho más al sur de lo que normalmente se encuentra, permitiendo que el aire frío se vuelque hacia el sur.

Pero este aire no se extendió a Estados Unidos este invierno. Es por eso que la primavera y el invierno han sido leves y las principales ciudades de la costa este registraron nevadas bajas.

Pero ahora, el vórtice polar se está debilitando, lo que permite que el aire del Ártico se salga de su lugar usual y provoque temperaturas bajas en la zona este durante el fin de semana.

Nevadas significativas para el interior de Nueva Inglaterra

La nieve comenzará en la región de los Grandes Lagos durante la tarde de este viernes. Para la noche y durante la madrugada, la nieve se extenderá desde los Apalaches centrales hasta partes del noreste.

“Parece que el interior de Nueva Inglaterra tendrá una cantidad significativa de nieve húmeda con viento del norte cada vez más fuerte y ráfagas desde la noche del viernes hasta el sábado por la mañana”, indicó el Centro de Predicción del Clima.

Incluso, hay una pequeña posibilidad –el 13%– de que la ciudad de Nueva York pueda tener nevadas el sábado temprano, según pronostica el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional.

En conclusión, este es un tiempo increíblemente frío, intenso e inusual para mayo.

Detroit, Indianápolis y Louisville, en Kentucky, podrían batir récords durante la madrugada del sábado, con bajas temperaturas entre los -6 y -1 grados Celsius.

Es probable que la nieve caiga sobre porciones de los Grandes Lagos, en las secciones interiores del noreste de este viernes al sábado, donde podrían registrarse acumulaciones."
http://cnn.com,Bukele defiende medidas drásticas y acusa a opositores de “querer ver cadáveres tirados en las aceras”,"El Salvador endurece las medidas de cuarentena 3:21

(CNN Español) — El presidente de El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, defendió este viernes la implementación de medidas más drásticas para disminuir la cantidad de gente en las calles y así reducir el riesgo de contagios por coronavirus.

Bukele llamó “escuadrones de la muerte 2.0” a un grupo de diputados de la conservadora Alianza Republicana Nacionalista (Arena), que este viernes pidió la inmediata derogación de las medidas vigentes por 15 días a partir del jueves.

Las nuevas disposiciones suspenden la circulación del transporte colectivo, impide a las personas cruzar de un municipio a otro y permite ir a mercados, supermercados, farmacias y hacer trámites bancarios solo dos veces por semana, de acuerdo con el último dígito del documento de identidad.

El partido Arena considera que esas decisiones afectan derechos constitucionales y se convierten en un “régimen de excepción disfrazado” al restringir la libertad de circulación de personas, productos y servicios esenciales, algo que no está contemplado en el decreto aprobado por la Asamblea Legislativa en la madrugada del pasado martes.

Bukele reconoce las incomodidades que causan las nuevas medidas adoptadas, pero advierte que “la única esperanza para evitar una catástrofe sanitaria” en El Salvador es que funcione la cuarentena especial y acusó a la oposición de “babear” “por ver cadáveres tirados en las aceras y poder culpar al Gobierno”.

La petición del partido Arena se suma a los llamados que hicieron al gobierno el jueves la Asociación Salvadoreña de Industriales (ASI) y la Asociación Nacional de la Empresa Privada (ANEP) para que derogue las medidas que han imposibilitado la operación de la mayoría de las empresas.

“El Estado debe asegurar el goce de la libertad, la salud y el bienestar económico de todos los habitantes. No es una o la otra. No es quitar unas por asegurar otra. Son todas al mismo tiempo”, aseguró Javier Simán, presidente de la ANEP.

El mandatario salvadoreño dijo el martes que si la cuarentena especial funcionaba reabrirían varios sectores de manera paulatina. Este viernes las gremiales empresariales se reunieron con Rolando Castro, ministro de Trabajo, para analizar los protocolos de seguridad que serían implementados al momento de reabrir las empresas."
http://cnn.com,Las tensiones y la reacciones violentas aumentan a medida que las reaperturas del coronavirus en Estados Unidos revelan una nueva forma de vida,"(CNN) — Con casi todos los estados reabiertos parcialmente esta semana, la reacción violenta y las frustraciones crecen a medida que los estadounidenses luchan con formas de combatir el mortal coronavirus.

Más de 45 estados el domingo relajarán las restricciones abriendo una combinación de empresas, servicios o parques, con la esperanza de levantar las economías aplastadas por una pandemia que ha matado a casi 76.000 personas en Estados Unidos e infectado a más de 1,2 millones.

Las comunidades más vulnerables, como los hogares de ancianos y las cárceles, son las más afectadas, y los expertos dicen que las cifras crecerán. Los investigadores predicen que el distanciamiento social relajado debido a las reaperturas conducirá a 134.000 muertes por coronavirus en todo el país para agosto, casi el doble de su pronóstico anterior.

Después de semanas de órdenes de confinamiento, manifestantes han salido a las calles durante días para exigir a los estados que abran sus negocios. Incluso los mandatos de usar máscaras para detener la propagación del virus se han convertido en un punto crítico, lo que ha llevado a un presunto asesinato y acusaciones de extralimitación del gobierno.

Los estados no están listos para reabrir, advierten los expertos

Los expertos en salud advierten que los estados no han cumplido con las pautas federales para la reapertura, incluidas las pruebas y el rastreo de casos más agresivos, y una trayectoria descendente de casos documentados en un período de 14 días. La reapertura corre el riesgo de desencadenar otra ola de la pandemia y sus efectos no se conocerán de inmediato.

“Pasarán al menos dos o tres semanas antes de que veamos un aumento en la cantidad de infecciones porque lleva tiempo que las personas infecten a otras y para que muestren síntomas”, dijo el científico de datos Youyang Gu, cuyo modelo de proyección de coronavirus se cita por los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC).

Levantar las medidas prematuramente podría conducir a un rebote del virus, colocando a Estados Unidos en el “mismo barco que estábamos hace unas semanas”, cuando la cantidad de infecciones se disparó a diario, dijo el doctor Anthony Fauci, miembro de Fuerza de Tarea contra el Coronavirus de la Casa Blanca.

Una nueva guía de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades ofrece sugerencias de reapertura más detalladas además de las proporcionadas por la administración el mes pasado, incluyendo detalles para escuelas e iglesias. Pero la administración Trump no lo implementará, dijo el jueves un alto funcionario de los CDC.

Las llamadas a usar máscaras se convierten en un punto de controversia

Para frenar la propagación prevista del virus, algunas ciudades piden a las personas que usen máscaras en lugares públicos. Pero esas pautas se han encontrado con resistencia, lo que ha llevado a confrontaciones.

En Michigan, dos incidentes por el uso de mascarillas llegaron a los titulares en todo el país. En uno, un guardia de seguridad de Family Dollar fue asesinado a tiros después de que le dijo a una mujer que usara una máscara facial, dijeron las autoridades. La policía también arrestó a un hombre que supuestamente se limpió la nariz con la manga de un empleado de Dollar Tree que le pidió que usara un tapabocas. Los manifestantes se han congregado en el Capitolio de Michigan durante días, exigiendo el fin del estado de emergencia vigente hasta el 28 de mayo. Pero la gobernador Gretchen Whitmer también relajó las restricciones para que algunas empresas puedan reabrir y el público pueda participar en actividades al aire libre como golf y paseos en bote motorizados.

A cientos de kilómetros de distancia, la ciudad de Stillwater, Oklahoma, revocó una orden que exigía a los residentes que se cubrieran la cara dentro de los edificios después de que los trabajadores recibieran amenazas.

Steven Taylor, psicólogo clínico y autor de “La psicología de las pandemias”, dijo que las personas tienden a rebelarse cuando se les dice qué hacer, incluso cuando las medidas son para protegerlos.

“La gente valora sus libertades”, dijo. “Pueden sentirse angustiados o indignados o moralmente indignados cuando las personas intentan invadir sus libertades”.

El virus está golpeando fuertemente a algunas comunidades vulnerables

A medida que algunas personas se rebelan contra las medidas de protección, el virus continúa golpeando con fuerza en lugares donde el distanciamiento social no es una opción.

Miles de internos han dado positivo por coronavirus en las prisiones federales y estatales, muchos de los cuales no mostraron síntomas. En Ohio, más del 20% de las personas infectadas con coronavirus son prisioneros. Y en Colorado, el brote más grande del estado se encuentra en una instalación correccional.

Las cosas son igual de malas en los hogares de ancianos, donde la población es especialmente vulnerable. En Louisiana, más del 30% de las muertes por coronavirus del estado son de hogares de ancianos y centros de atención a largo plazo. En Nueva Hampshire, representan casi el 80% de los casos, mientras que en Arkansas, casi la mitad de todos los casos del estado se encuentran en prisiones y hogares de ancianos.

Los funcionarios en varios estados han pedido más pruebas en centros correccionales y hogares de ancianos.

“Los asilos de ancianos han sido la zona cero para el covid-19”, dijo Seema Verma, administradora de los Centros de Servicios de Medicare y Medicaid.

La comunidad negra ha pagado un alto precio

Estados Unidos tiene un problema de desigualdad y la crisis del coronavirus lo está empeorando.

Negros y latinos, más vulnerables a impacto del covid-19 2:56

La pandemia está dejando a pocas personas intactas, pero la cifra es mucho más mortal para la comunidad negra, que están muriendo en mayor número.

Los negros representan el 13,4% de la población estadounidense. Pero los condados con mayores poblaciones negras representan más de la mitad de todos los casos de coronavirus y casi el 60% de las muertes, según un nuevo estudio.

Las disparidades, incluido el acceso a la atención médica, probablemente sean las culpables, concluyeron los investigadores.

“Los factores estructurales que incluyen el acceso a la atención médica, la densidad de hogares, el desempleo, la discriminación generalizada y otros impulsan estas disparidades”, dijeron los investigadores. “Las condiciones sociales, el racismo estructural y otros factores elevan el riesgo de diagnósticos y muertes por covid-19 en las comunidades negras”.

En el estudio participaron científicos de las universidades Emory y Johns Hopkins, el Centro Médico de la Universidad de Mississippi y la Universidad de Georgetown.

De los más de 3.100 condados que los investigadores estudiaron casos de coronavirus desde fines de enero hasta mediados de abril, encontraron que las muertes fueron más altas en los condados desproporcionadamente negros de zonas rurales y pequeñas de áreas metropolitanas.

Los resultados ofrecen un panorama mundial de los casos de coronavirus en tiempo real.

El mapa interactivo señala las regiones donde los pacientes han sido diagnosticados con coronavirus: cuantos más casos haya en una región, más grande será su punto en el mapa.

El mapa también rastrea muertes, en total y por ciudad.

Lauren Gardner, directora del Centro de Ciencia e Ingeniería de Sistemas y profesora de ingeniería civil en Johns Hopkins, dijo a principios de febrero que el mapa no es solo un recurso para el público: los funcionarios de salud pueden descargar los datos, que servirá para la investigación sobre el coronavirus en el futuro.

“Creamos este panel de control porque creemos que es importante que el público comprenda la situación del brote a medida que se desarrolla con fuentes de datos transparentes”, dijo. “Para la comunidad investigadora, estos datos serán más valiosos a medida que continuemos recopilándolos con el tiempo”.

El mapa también pone el brote en perspectiva, con miles de casos confirmados en China continental y en otras partes del mundo.

¿Qué es un coronavirus?

Los coronavirus son un gran grupo de virus que son comunes entre los animales. En casos raros, son lo que los científicos llaman zoonótico, lo que significa que pueden transmitirse de animales a humanos, según los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EE.UU., CDC por sus siglas en inglés. El nuevo coronavirus fue denominado por la OMS como COVID-19.

Los síntomas de un coronavirus

Los virus pueden enfermar a las personas, generalmente con una enfermedad leve o moderada del tracto respiratorio superior, similar a un resfriado común. Los síntomas del coronavirus incluyen secreción nasal, tos, dolor de garganta, posiblemente dolor de cabeza y quizás fiebre, que puede durar un par de días.

Para aquellos con un sistema inmunitario debilitado, los ancianos y los muy jóvenes, existe la posibilidad de que el virus pueda causar una enfermedad del tracto respiratorio más baja y mucho más grave, como una neumonía o bronquitis.

Hay un puñado de coronavirus humanos que se sabe que son mortales.

El síndrome respiratorio del Medio Oriente, también conocido como el virus MERS, se informó por primera vez en el Medio Oriente en 2012 y también causa problemas respiratorios, pero esos síntomas son mucho más graves. Según los CDC, murieron entre tres y cuatro de cada 10 pacientes infectados con MERS.

El síndrome respiratorio agudo severo, también conocido como SARS, es el otro coronavirus que puede causar síntomas más graves. Identificado por primera vez en la provincia de Guangdong en el sur de China, según la OMS, causa problemas respiratorios pero también puede causar diarrea, fatiga, falta de aliento, dificultad respiratoria e insuficiencia renal.

Dependiendo de la edad del paciente, la tasa de mortalidad con SARS varió del 0 al 50% de los casos, siendo las personas mayores las más vulnerables.

Actualmente se cree que el nuevo coronavirus es más leve que el SARS y el MERS y lleva más tiempo desarrollar síntomas. Los pacientes hasta la fecha han experimentado una tos leve durante una semana seguida de dificultad para respirar, lo que hace que visiten el hospital, explica Peter Horby, profesor de enfermedades infecciosas emergentes y salud global en la Universidad de Oxford. Hasta ahora, alrededor del 15% al ​​20% de los casos se han vuelto graves y requieren, por ejemplo, ventilación en el hospital.

Cómo se propaga

Mira la evolución del contagio del coronavirus alrededor del mundo https://t.co/GmIRjloSnK pic.twitter.com/n9XYnifwL6 — CNN en Español (@CNNEE) March 12, 2020

Los virus pueden propagarse por el contacto humano con animales. Los científicos creen que MERS comenzó en camellos, según la OMS. Con el SARS, los científicos sospechaban que los gatos de civeta tenían la culpa.

¿Cómo se contagia el nuevo coronavirus? 0:25

Cuando se trata de la transmisión de virus de persona a persona, a menudo ocurre cuando alguien entra en contacto con las secreciones de una persona infectada, como las gotas en la tos.

Dependiendo de qué tan virulento sea el virus, una tos, un estornudo o un apretón de manos pueden causar exposición. El virus también se puede transmitir al tocar algo que una persona infectada ha tocado y luego tocarse la boca, la nariz o los ojos. Los cuidadores a veces pueden estar expuestos al manipular los desechos de un paciente, según los CDC.

¿Debe China prohibir el comercio de animales silvestres? 1:57

Se ha confirmado la transmisión de persona a persona para el nuevo coronavirus, pero los expertos ahora están tratando de entender quién la transmite más, quién tiene mayor riesgo y si la transmisión se produce principalmente en hospitales o en la comunidad. El SARS y el MERS se transmitieron en gran medida dentro de los hospitales, dijo Horby. Algunas personas también se consideran “superprogadores”, un término que la OMS pide no usar.

Volver al menú

¿A quién afecta?

El MERS, el SARS y el nuevo coronavirus parecen causar una enfermedad más grave en las personas mayores, aunque persiste la incertidumbre sobre el último brote. Según Horby la edad promedio es de personas de 40 años o más, dijo.

No existe un tratamiento específico, pero se están realizando investigaciones. La mayoría de las veces, los síntomas desaparecerán por sí solos y los expertos aconsejan buscar atención temprana. Si los síntomas se sienten peor que un resfriado estándar, consulta a tu médico.

Los médicos pueden aliviar los síntomas prescribiendo medicamentos para el dolor o la fiebre. Los CDC dicen que un humidificador de habitación o una ducha caliente pueden ayudar con el dolor de garganta o la tos.

Bebe muchos líquidos, descansa y duerme lo más posible.

¿Cómo puedes prevenirlo?

No existe una vacuna para proteger contra esta familia de virus, al menos todavía no. Los ensayos para una vacuna MERS están en marcha. Los Institutos Nacionales de Salud de EE.UU. están trabajando en una vacuna contra el nuevo virus, pero pasarán meses hasta que se inicien los ensayos clínicos y más de un año hasta que esté disponible.

¿Qué funciona para prevenirte del coronavirus? 2:22

Es posible que pueda reducir su riesgo de infección evitando a las personas enfermas. Trata de evitar tocarte los ojos, la nariz y la boca. Lávate las manos con frecuencia con agua y jabón y durante al menos 20 segundos.

La conciencia es la clave. Si estás enfermo y tienes razones para creer que puede ser el nuevo coronavirus debido a un viaje a la región o al contacto con alguien que ha estado allí, debes informar a un proveedor de atención médica y buscar tratamiento temprano.

Cúbrete la boca y la nariz cuando tosas o estornudes, y desinfecta los objetos y las superficies que toques.

Si viajas a China, ten en cuenta los síntomas y evita los mercados de animales vivos, que es donde comenzó el último brote en Wuhan.

¿Qué es una pandemia?

La mortal pandemia del nuevo coronavirus ha puesto de relieve la ciencia de la enfermedad, planteando la pregunta: ¿qué es exactamente una pandemia?

Un brote es la aparición de casos de enfermedades que exceden lo que normalmente se espera, según la Organización Mundial de la Salud. Una epidemia es más que un número normal de casos de enfermedad, el comportamiento específico relacionado con la salud u otros eventos relacionados con la salud en una comunidad o región.

Sin embargo, una pandemia se define como la “propagación mundial” de una nueva enfermedad.

La anterior pandemia reportada en el mundo fue la pandemia de gripe H1N1 en 2009, que mató a cientos de miles en todo el mundo.

¿Es alergia, gripe o coronavirus? ¿Cómo saber la diferencia?

Si bien el coronavirus es algo que debe tomarse en serio, las posibilidades de que una persona lo contraiga aún son bajas. Pero si te preguntas si esa nariz tapada podría terminar siendo el peor de los casos, CNN habló con el doctor Greg Poland, profesor de Medicina y Enfermedades Infecciosas de la Clínica Mayo y director del Grupo de Investigación de Vacunas de la Clínica Mayo, sobre diferencias entre los síntomas típicos de alergia, resfriado y gripe, y los asociados con el coronavirus.

Cuando la Organización Mundial de la Salud declaró que el brote del nuevo coronavirus era una emergencia de salud pública de preocupación internacional, lo hizo por temor a las dificultades que los países más pequeños o menos desarrollados tengan para contener el virus.

La enfermedad respiratoria similar a la gripe es altamente contagiosa y el brote ha abrumado a los hospitales en la ciudad china de Wuhan, donde se identificó por primera vez. Las autoridades chinas cerraron ciudades enteras, suspendieron el transporte público y cerraron escuelas, negocios y fábricas en un esfuerzo por contenerlo.

Los países cercanos a China en el sudeste y este de Asia han soportado la peor parte de las infecciones fuera del continente, con Japón, Corea del Sur, Vietnam y Tailandia registrando transmisiones locales.

Algunas de esas naciones con infecciones por coronavirus y sus vecinos se encuentran entre los países más pobres y propensos a desastres del mundo.

Los expertos han expresado su temor de que la infraestructura de atención médica en estos países pueda desmoronarse bajo el peso de un brote, y dañar gravemente sus economías, provocar desplazamientos masivos y causar otras muertes sin virus.

Un estudio publicado en la revista médica JAMA encontró que el 41% de los primeros 138 pacientes diagnosticados en un hospital en Wuhan, China, supuestamente se infectaron en ese hospital. El Dr. Tom Frieden es el exdirector de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EE..UU. y excomisionado del Departamento de Salud de la Ciudad de Nueva York, explica por qué es una gran noticia. En lenguaje simple —dice Frieden— eso significa que casi la mitad de las infecciones iniciales en este hospital parecen haberse propagado dentro del propio hospital. Esto se llama transmisión nosocomial.

¿Pueden las mascotas contagiar el coronavirus?

Es tu mejor amigo peludo y algo fijo en tu hogar, pero ¿podría tu amado gato o perro contagiarte el coronavirus? Los expertos están de acuerdo, casi definitivamente no.

Hubo temores similares sobre la propagación del coronavirus a las mascotas durante el brote de SARS en 2003, cuando más de 280 personas murieron en Hong Kong. Los expertos creen que tanto el SARS como el Covid-19 probablemente se originaron en los murciélagos.

Los perros y los gatos contraen algunos coronavirus, pero no el mismo que el virus asociado con este brote actual, dijo Jane Gray, cirujana veterinaria en jefe de la SPCA de Hong Kong. Esas cepas son de un tipo completamente diferente y no causan problemas respiratorios.

En 2003, los científicos dijeron que la posibilidad de contraer SARS, que también es un tipo de coronavirus, de un gato era extremadamente remota.

Gray, que trabajaba en Hong Kong durante el SARS, dijo que el virus fue encontrado en una pequeña cantidad de gatos, pero no había evidencia de que pudieran transmitirlo a los humanos.

Según los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EE. UU., la principal forma en que la enfermedad se está propagando es de persona a persona, ya sea cuando las personas están juntas, o de las gotas respiratorias cuando una persona infectada tose y estornuda.

http://cnn.com,Síntomas del coronavirus: 10 indicadores clave y qué hacer,"¿Están cambiando los síntomas del coronavirus? 0:48

(CNN) — Los científicos están aprendiendo más cada día sobre el misterioso nuevo coronavirus y los síntomas de covid-19, la enfermedad que causa.



Fiebre, tos y dificultad para respirar se encuentran en la gran mayoría de todos los casos de covid-19. Pero hay señales adicionales del virus, algunas muy parecidas al resfriado o la gripe, y otras que son más inusuales.

Según los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EE. UU., cualquiera o todos los síntomas pueden aparecer entre dos y 14 días después de la exposición al virus.

Aquí hay 10 señales de que tú o un ser querido pueden tener covid-19, y qué hacer para protegerte y proteger a tu familia.

Así se enteró este niño que obtuvo un nuevo corazón 1:46

1. Falta de aliento

La falta de aliento no suele ser un síntoma temprano de covid-19, pero es el más grave. Puede ocurrir solo, sin tos. Si su pecho se tensa o comienza a sentir que no puede respirar lo suficiente como para llenar sus pulmones de aire, esa es una señal para actuar rápidamente, dicen los expertos.

“Si hay dificultad para respirar, llame de inmediato a su proveedor de atención médica, a una atención de urgencia local o al departamento de emergencias”, dijo el presidente de la Asociación Médica Americana, Dr. Patrice Harris.

“Si la dificultad para respirar es lo suficientemente grave, debe llamar al 911”, agregó Harris.

Los CDC enumeran otras señales de advertencia de emergencia para covid-19 como “dolor o presión persistente en el pecho” y “labios o cara azulados”, lo que puede indicar una falta de oxígeno.

Obtén atención médica de inmediato, dicen los CDC.

2. Fiebre

La fiebre es un signo clave de covid-19. Debido a que algunas personas pueden tener una temperatura corporal general inferior o superior a los típicos 98,6 grados Fahrenheit (37 grados Celsius), los expertos dicen que no debes fijarte en un número.

El presentador de CNN Chris Cuomo, que está luchando contra el virus desde su casa en Nueva York, es una de esas personas.

“Tengo una temperatura un poco más fría. Mi temperatura normal es de 97,6, no de 98,6. Por lo tanto, incluso cuando estoy en 99 eso no sería un gran problema para la mayoría de las personas. Pero, para mí, ya estoy caliente”, dijo Cuomo al Dr. Sanjay Gupta, corresponsal médico jefe de CNN.

Sin embargo, la mayoría de los niños y adultos no serán considerados febriles hasta que su temperatura alcance los 100 grados Fahrenheit (37,7 grados Celsius).

“Hay muchos conceptos erróneos sobre la fiebre”, dijo el Dr. John Williams, jefe de la división de enfermedades infecciosas pediátricas del Hospital de Niños de Pittsburgh del Centro Médico de la Universidad de Pittsburgh.

“Todos subimos y bajamos bastante durante el día hasta la mitad de un grado o un grado”, dijo Williams, y agregó que para la mayoría de las personas “99,0 grados o 99,5 grados Fahrenheit no es fiebre”.

MIRA: Así son las clínicas móviles en California para personas con síntomas del covid-19

No confíes en una temperatura tomada por la mañana, dijo el Dr. William Schaffner, experto en enfermedades infecciosas, profesor de medicina preventiva y enfermedades infecciosas en la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Vanderbilt en Nashville. En cambio, toma su temperatura al final de la tarde y al anochecer.

“Nuestra temperatura no es la misma durante el día. Si la tomas a las ocho de la mañana, puede ser normal”, explicó Schaffner.

“Una de las presentaciones más comunes de fiebre es que su temperatura sube al final de la tarde y al anochecer. Es una forma común en que los virus producen fiebre”.

3. Tos seca

La tos es otro síntoma común, pero no es una tos cualquiera.

“No es un cosquilleo en la garganta. No solo te estás aclarando la garganta. No solo está irritado”, explicó Schaffner.

La tos es molesta, una tos seca que siente profundamente en el pecho.

“Proviene de tu esternón, y notas que sus bronquios están inflamados o irritados”, agregó Schaffner.

Un informe publicado por la Organización Mundial de la Salud en febrero descubrió que más del 33% de 55.924 personas con casos confirmados por laboratorio de covid-19 habían tosido esputo, un moco espeso a veces llamado flema, de sus pulmones.

4. Escalofríos y dolores corporales

“La bestia sale de noche”, dijo Cuomo, refiriéndose a los escalofríos, dolores en el cuerpo y fiebre alta que lo visitaron el 1 de abril.

‘Era como si alguien me estuviera golpeando como una piñata. Y estaba temblando tanto que… me partí un diente. Los llaman los rigores”, dijo desde su sótano, donde está en cuarentena lejos del resto de su familia.

“Estaba alucinando. Mi papá me estaba hablando. Estaba viendo gente de la universidad, gente que no había visto en muchos años, era extraño”, dijo Cuomo.

No todos tendrán una reacción tan severa, dicen los expertos. Algunos pueden no tener escalofríos o dolores corporales.

Otros pueden experimentar escalofríos similares a la gripe, fatiga y dolor en las articulaciones y los músculos, lo que puede dificultar saber si la culpa es de la gripe o el coronavirus.

Una posible señal de que podrías tener covid-19 es si tus síntomas no mejoran después de una semana más o menos, pero en realidad empeoran.

5. Confusión repentina

Hablando de signos de empeoramiento, los CDC dicen que una confusión repentina o la incapacidad de despertarse y estar alerta puede ser una señal grave de que se puede necesitar atención de emergencia. Si tú o un ser querido tienen esos síntomas, especialmente con otros signos críticos como labios azulados, problemas para respirar o dolor en el pecho, los CDC dicen que busques ayuda de inmediato.

6. Problemas digestivos

Al principio, la ciencia no pensaba que la diarrea u otros problemas gástricos típicos que a menudo vienen con la gripe se aplicaran al nuevo coronavirus, también conocido como SARS-CoV-2. A medida que se dispone de más investigaciones sobre los sobrevivientes, esa opinión ha cambiado.

“En un estudio realizado en China, donde analizaron a algunos de los primeros pacientes, unas 200 personas, descubrieron que los síntomas digestivos o estomacales (gastrointestinales) en realidad estaban presentes en aproximadamente la mitad de los pacientes”, dijo Gupta en el programa de noticias New Day de CNN.

En general, “creo que estamos obteniendo un poco más de información sobre los tipos de síntomas que los pacientes pueden tener”, dijo Gupta.

El estudio describió un subconjunto único de casos más leves en los que los síntomas iniciales fueron problemas digestivos como diarrea, a menudo sin fiebre. Esos pacientes experimentaron demoras en las pruebas y el diagnóstico que los pacientes con problemas respiratorios, y tardaron más en eliminar el virus de sus sistemas.

7. Conjuntivitis

Investigaciones de China, Corea del Sur y otras partes del mundo indican que alrededor del 1% al 3% de las personas con covid-19 también tenían conjuntivitis.

La conjuntivitis, una afección altamente contagiosa causada por un virus, es una inflamación de la capa delgada y transparente de tejido, llamada conjuntiva, que cubre la parte blanca del ojo y el interior del párpado.

La República de los Niños ahora es hospital por el covid-19 2:58

Pero el SARS-CoV-2 es solo uno de los muchos virus que pueden causar conjuntivitis, por lo que no fue una verdadera sorpresa para los científicos que este virus recién descubierto hiciera lo mismo.

Aún así, un ojo rosado o rojo podría ser una señal más de que debe llamar a tu médico si también tienes otros síntomas reveladores de covid-19, como fiebre, tos o falta de aliento.

8. Pérdida del olfato y del gusto

En casos leves a moderados de coronavirus, la pérdida del olfato y el gusto está emergiendo como uno de los primeros signos más inusuales de covid-19.

“Lo que se llama anosmia, que básicamente significa pérdida de olfato, parece ser un síntoma que desarrollaron varios pacientes”, dijo el Dr. Sanjay Gupta, corresponsal médico jefe de CNN, al presentador de CNN Alisyn Camerota en New Day.

“Puede estar relacionado con la pérdida del gusto, con la pérdida del apetito, no estamos seguros, pero claramente es algo a tener en cuenta”, dijo Gupta. “A veces, estos primeros síntomas no son los clásicos”.

“La anosmia, en particular, se ha visto en pacientes que finalmente dieron positivo para el coronavirus sin otros síntomas”, según la Academia Americana de Otorrinolaringología-Cirugía de Cabeza y Cuello.

Un análisis reciente de casos más leves en Corea del Sur encontró que el síntoma principal que presentaban el 30% de los pacientes era la pérdida del olfato. En Alemania, más de dos de cada tres casos confirmados tenían anosmia.

MIRA: Coronavirus: ¿qué puede pasar con la deuda en medio de la pandemia?

Desde hace tiempo se sabe en la literatura médica que una pérdida repentina del olfato puede estar asociada con infecciones respiratorias causadas por otros tipos de coronavirus, por lo que no fue una sorpresa que el nuevo coronavirus tuviera este efecto, según ENT UK, una organización profesional que representa a cirujanos de oído, nariz y garganta en el Reino Unido.

¿Hay algo que puedas hacer en casa para probar si estás perdiendo el olfato? La respuesta es sí, mediante el uso de la “prueba del caramelo” para determinar si los olores fluyen desde la parte posterior de la boca hacia arriba a través de la faringe nasal y hacia la cavidad nasal. La idea es tomar un dulce y ponerlo en tu boca mientras sostienes tu nariz para que no entre aire. Mastica, y luego suelta el agarre de tu nariz. Si tu olfato está bien percibirás inmediatamente el sabor. Si puedes distinguir entre sabores distintos, como naranjas y limones, tu sentido del olfato está funcionando bien.

9. Fatiga

Para algunas personas, la fatiga extrema puede ser un signo temprano del nuevo coronavirus. El informe de la OMS encontró que casi el 40% de las casi 6.000 personas con casos confirmados por laboratorio experimentaron fatiga.

Apenas unos días después de su cuarentena, Cuomo ya estaba agotado por las fiebres y los dolores corporales que causa la enfermedad.

“Estoy tan letárgico que puedo mirar afuera y, de repende, pasa una hora y media”, dijo Cuomo a Gupta en Anderson Cooper 360. “Creo que tomé una siesta de 10 minutos, y fue de tres horas y media.”

La fatiga puede continuar mucho después de que el virus desaparezca. Los informes anecdóticos de personas que se han recuperado de covid-19 dicen que el agotamiento y la falta de energía continúan mucho más allá del período de recuperación estándar de unas pocas semanas.

Lo que sabemos de la hidroxicloroquina contra el covid-19 2:23

10. Dolor de cabeza, dolor de garganta, congestión

El informe de la OMS también encontró que casi el 14% de los casi 6.000 casos de covid-19 en China tenían síntomas de dolor de cabeza y dolor de garganta, mientras que casi el 5% tenía congestión nasal.

Ciertamente, no son los signos más comunes de la enfermedad, pero obviamente son similares a los resfriados y la gripe. De hecho, muchos síntomas de covid-19 pueden parecerse a la gripe, incluidos los dolores de cabeza y los problemas digestivos, dolores corporales y fatiga mencionados anteriormente. Otros síntomas más pueden parecerse a un resfriado o alergias, como dolor de garganta y congestión.

Lo más probable, según los expertos, es que simplemente tengas un resfriado o gripe; después de todo, también pueden causar fiebre y tos.

Entonces, ¿qué deberías hacer?

“En este momento, la orientación actual, y esto puede cambiar, es que si tiene síntomas similares al resfriado y la gripe y estos son síntomas leves a síntomas moderados, quédate en casa e intenta controlarlos” con descanso, hidratación y el uso de medicamentos para reducir la fiebre, dijo Harris de la AMA.

Ese consejo no se aplica si tienes más de 60 años, ya que el sistema inmunitario se debilita a medida que envejecemos o si estás embarazada. Cualquier persona con inquietudes sobre el coronavirus debe llamar a su proveedor de atención médica, según los CDC.

No está claro si las mujeres embarazadas tienen una mayor probabilidad de enfermarse gravemente por el coronavirus, pero los CDC han dicho que las mujeres experimentan cambios en sus cuerpos durante el embarazo que pueden aumentar el riesgo de algunas infecciones.

MIRA: Es probable que el recuento de muertes por coronavirus en EE. UU. esté subestimado. ¿Por qué?

En general, las infecciones por covid-19 son más riesgosas si tienes condiciones de salud subyacentes como diabetes, enfermedad pulmonar crónica o asma, insuficiencia cardíaca o enfermedad cardíaca, anemia falciforme, cáncer (o si estás recibiendo quimioterapia), enfermedad renal con diálisis, un índice de masa corporal (IMC) mayor de 40 (extremadamente obeso) o un trastorno autoinmune.

“Los pacientes mayores y las personas que tienen afecciones médicas subyacentes o están inmunocomprometidos deben comunicarse con su médico temprano incluso en el curso de una enfermedad leve”, aconseja el CDC.

Para ser claros, tienes un mayor riesgo, incluso si eres joven, si tienes problemas de salud subyacentes.

“Las personas menores de 60 años con enfermedades subyacentes, con diabetes, enfermedades cardíacas, inmunocomprometidos o con algún tipo de enfermedad pulmonar anterior, son más vulnerables a pesar de su corta edad”, dijo Schaffner.

Un historial de viajes a un área donde el nuevo coronavirus está muy extendido (y esas partes del mundo, incluido EE. UU., aumentan cada día) es obviamente otro factor clave para decidir si sus síntomas pueden ser covid-19 o no.

Cómo ser evaluado

Si no tienes síntomas, no solicites pruebas ni te agregues a la cantidad de llamadas pendientes en los centros de pruebas, clínicas, hospitales y similares, dicen los expertos.

“No evaluamos a personas sin síntomas porque tenemos un problema de recursos”, dijo Schaffner sobre el centro de evaluación en Vanderbilt. “Sin embargo, estamos enfatizando que las personas que tienen este pequeño grupo de síntomas importantes (fiebre y todo lo relacionado con el tracto respiratorio inferior, como tos y dificultad para respirar) deben acercarse para ser evaluados”.

Si tienes esos tres signos, ¿a dónde debes ir?

“Si tienes seguro y estás buscando un proveedor o alguien con quien llamar o conectarte, siempre hay un número en el reverso de tu tarjeta de seguro; o hay información para los pacientes en línea”, dijo Harris.

“Si no tienes seguro, puedes comenzar con el departamento de salud estatal o los centros de salud comunitarios locales, que se conocen oficialmente como centros de salud calificados federalmente”, aconsejó Harris, y agregó que algunos estados tienen un número de teléfono directo 1-800 para llamar.

“Si hay un centro de pruebas y evaluación cerca de ti, puede ir allí directamente”, dijo Schaffer. “Siempre es bueno notificarles que irás. De lo contrario, debe llamar a su proveedor de atención médica y te indicarán qué hacer”.

http://cnn.com,Cómo hacer tu propia mascarilla protectora,"(CNN) — Hay una cosa que debes saber antes de involucrarte en la conversación sobre las mascarillas: el público no debe comprar máscaras protectoras N95. Los trabajadores de la salud los necesitan cuando tratan a pacientes con coronavirus.

También debes tener en cuenta:

Se recomienda cubrirse la cara, pero no es obligatorio

Las mascarillas hechas en casa no son un sustituto del distanciamiento social y el confinamiento en casa

Sin embargo, si deseas hacer una máscara, aquí hay instrucciones paso a paso, basadas en la guía del Vanderbilt University Medical Center y el Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin.

¿No estás seguro de cómo usar o limpiar las máscaras? Respondemos esas preguntas abajo de estas instrucciones para hacer máscaras.

Materiales que necesitarás

2 piezas de tela de algodón de tejido apretado, de 9 x 6 pulgadas (por máscara) -23 x 15 cm-

4 tiras de tela, de 2 x 16 pulgadas (por máscara) -5 x 40 cm–

Una regla

Máquina de coser o aguja e hilo

Lápiz o marcador

Tijeras

Un puñado de alfileres

Plancha

Haz tu máscara

Corta tu tela en dos rectángulos de 9 x 6 pulgadas (23 x 15 cm). Ubícalos uno encima del otro.

2. En la parte superior del lado de 9 pulgadas (23 cm), fija o marca una abertura de 2 pulgadas (5 cm) en el centro del borde superior del lado de 9 pulgadas (23 cm), entre los puntos de 3,5 (9 cm) y 5,5 pulgadas (14 cm) , a lo largo del borde superior. Luego, cose los bordes a cada lado de donde fijaste o marcaste la apertura. Necesitarás esa abertura de 2 pulgadas (5 cm) para girar la máscara hacia afuera.

3. Cose también los otros tres lados de la máscara.

4. Voltea la máscara hacia el lado derecho a través de la abertura de 2 pulgadas (5 cm) que dejaste en la parte superior. Luego, presiona la máscara con una plancha para eliminar las arrugas.

5. Alinea tu regla verticalmente a lo largo del lado de 6 pulgadas (15 cm) de la máscara. Comenzando en la línea de 1,5 (3,8 cm) pulgadas, fija donde coserás los pliegues por el costado. Estos pliegues ayudan a que la máscara se estire.

Marca nuevamente en las líneas de 2, 3, 3,5, 4,5 y 5 pulgadas. (5; 7,6; 8,8; 11,4 y 12,7 cm)

Lleva el alfiler a la la línea de 1,5 pulgadas (3,8 cm)hasta la línea de 2 pulgadas (5 cm) y listo, ¡hiciste un pliegue! Repite con la línea de 3 pulgadas (7,6 cm) a 3,5 pulgadas (8,8 cm) y la línea de 4,5 pulgadas (11,4 cm) a 5 pulgadas (12,7 cm). Fija tus nuevos pliegues y repite en el otro lado. Cose los lados de tu máscara para que los pliegues se coloquen planos.

Haz las uniones de la máscara

Corta cuatro tiras de tela, de 2 pulgadas (5 cm) de ancho por 16 pulgadas (40 cm) de largo.

Dobla por la mitad a lo largo.

Gíralos debajo de 1/4-pulgada (0,6 cm) en el lado largo.

Plánchalos en su lugar, luego cose el lado largo cerrado.

Marca cada unión a una esquina de la máscara.

Cose alrededor del perímetro de la máscara una vez más para que se unan los lazos, y ya completaste tu máscara.



Preguntas frecuentes sobre las máscaras

¿Cómo la usas?

Las máscaras solo funcionan si las usas correctamente. La Organización Mundial de la Salud tiene las siguientes instrucciones:

Lávate las manos durante 20 segundos con agua y jabón antes de tocar o ponerte la máscara.

Asegúrate de cubrir toda la nariz y la boca cuando te la pongas.

Evita tocar la máscara mientras estás fuera, esto puede contaminarla.

No te quites la máscara mientras estás en público.

Para quitarte la máscara cuando llegues a casa, desátala desde atrás y no toques el la porta frontal.

Debes lavar inmediatamente la máscara después de regresar para que no contamines tus pertenencias.

Lávate las manos inmediatamente después de quitártela y nuevamente después de lavar la máscara.

¿Son efectivas las máscaras?

Los estudios sobre mascarillas hechas en casa han demostrado que son significativamente menos efectivas que las mascarillas quirúrgicas, y ciertamente no reemplazan los las máscaras esenciales N95 que los trabajadores de la salud deben usar para tratar a los pacientes.

“Las máscaras caseras son parcialmente efectivas”, dijo el Dr. Koushik Kasanagottu, residente de medicina interna en el Centro Médico Johns Hopkins Bayview en Maryland.

Ofrecen una barrera física contra las partículas virales, indicó, pero no contienen los filtros de las máscaras N95.

Pero son mejores que nada, especialmente para las personas que solo salen para una visita rápida a la tienda de comestibles o la farmacia, aseguraron Anna Davies y Raina MacIntyre, investigadoras de salud pública y autoras de dos estudios diferentes sobre la efectividad de máscara de tela.

Sin embargo, es importante tener en cuenta que las máscaras no pueden reemplazar las medidas de distanciamiento social. Mantener al menos 2 metros de distancia de los demás y quedarse en casa tanto como sea posible sigue siendo la mejor manera de prevenir la propagación del virus.

¿Cómo las limpias?

Debes lavar las máscaras antes y después de cada uso para limpiar los gérmenes que pueda haber recogido en lugares públicos. Lava a mano las máscaras o colócalas en una bolsa de lavado de malla en la lavadora para que no se desmoronen, y usa una configuración de calor alto.

¿Qué pasa si mi tienda está cerrada o sin suministros?

Algunos artesanos en Etsy todavía no han agotado todas sus máscaras faciales. Es difícil discernir cuán efectivas son estas mascarillas ya que no las creaste tú mismo, pero puedes compararlas con nuestro tutorial de máscaras antes de adquirirlas: ¿cubre la nariz y boca? ¿Hay pliegues? ¿Sellará herméticamente alrededor de tu cara?

Es probable que no necesites comprar más de unas pocas máscaras; los médicos recomiendan que solo un miembro de cada hogar realice mandados en público.

Puede llevar más tiempo de lo normal enviar las máscaras, así que ten en cuenta esto cuando las compres.

Y asegúrate de lavar las máscaras antes de usarlas.

Si no puedes acceder a las máscaras, sigue lavándote las manos, manteniendo la distancia de los demás y siguiendo otras medidas de distanciamiento social. Quedarse en casa es la mejor defensa contra el coronavirus, después de todo.

http://cnn.com,¿Has perdido tu empleo? Dedica 30 minutos a reducir estos tres gastos principales en el hogar,"Cuando tienes problemas para llegar a fin de mes, hay tres cosas básicas que puedes hacer: aumentar tus ingresos, reducir tus costes o endeudarse.

Si eres uno de los 33.5 millones de estadounidenses que han perdido su trabajo, aumentar tus ingresos no es una opción en este momento. Si bien la compensación por desempleo puede ayudarte a mantenerte a flote por un tiempo, tampoco puedes confiar en él a largo plazo.

Entonces, si no puedes aumentar tus ingresos en este momento, debes apoyarte en las dos opciones restantes: reducir tus gastos o acumular deudas. Hay formas inteligentes de hacer esto último, y las abordaremos en futuros artículos. Pero hoy, cubriremos cómo reducir tus gastos de manera que causen la menor cantidad de dolor. Puede ser más fácil de lo que piensas.

Endereza tu vida: automóvil, casa, entretenimiento

Las personas tienden a gastar la mayoría de su dinero en tres áreas principales: los automóviles, los costes de vivienda y el entretenimiento. Si vas a reducir tus gastos, primero querrás ver esas categorías, ya que es allí donde es probable que obtenga el máximo provecho a un recorte.

Comencemos con tu auto. Si no lo estás utilizando tanto como lo hacías antes, ahora que ya no viajas, es posible que puedas reducir los costos de tu seguro de automóvil con una llamada telefónica rápida. Y sí, realmente puede ser rápido.

Así que aquí está tu primera tarea: Reserva 10 minutos hoy, no mañana, hoy, para encontrar la información de tu seguro de automóvil (probablemente esté en la guantera de su automóvil) y llama a tu compañía o agente de seguros. Díle que ahora conduces menos y pregunta qué opciones están disponibles para reducir tus primas.

“Puedes ahorrar del 5% al ​​10%”, explica Dan Karr, CEO de ValChoice, una compañía de análisis de datos que actúa como un guardián de la industria de seguros.

Algunas compañías también te permitirán cambiar tus estimaciones anuales de millas, aunque pueden requerir que se instales una aplicación o dispositivo celular para medir las millas recorridas. Pero, dice Karr, “una reducción de 12,000 millas por año a 3,000 millas por año debería generar aproximadamente un 25% de ahorro”.

Además, algunas compañías de seguros están ofreciendo reembolsos en las primas, por lo tanto, mientras hablas con tu compañía o agente de seguros, pregunta si hay algún crédito o reembolso del que puedas beneficiarte. Y si una prima rebajada es aún más de lo que tu presupuesto puede soportar en este momento, solicita que se aplacen sus pagos, que es una opción que ofrecen algunas compañías de seguros.

Pero ten cuidado, porque a diferencia de un reembolso, diferir los pagos significa que aún deberás el dinero en el futuro. “Los conductores deben asegurarse de que podrán pagar cuando venza el pago”, dice Karr. “Algunas compañías de seguros aumentarán el precio del seguro cuando haya más de un pago atrasado, por lo que los conductores deben asegurarse de no terminar en esta situación”.

¿Quieres ahorrar aún más dinero en tu automóvil? Considera hacer una segunda llamada telefónica a su agencia de financiación y solicita diferir los pagos de tu préstamo para automóvil, o incluso refinanciar el préstamo. Dado que las tasas de interés se han desplomado en los últimos meses, es posible que puedas obtener una tasa más baja que la que tiene actualmente, y también extender la duración del préstamo al mismo tiempo, lo que reducirá aún más tus pagos.

Seamos francos: tomará más de 10 minutos refinanciar tu préstamo de automóvil y es posible que tengas problemas para hacerlo si actualmente no tiene ingresos. Por lo tanto, usa tus primeros 10 minutos para reducir el pago de tu seguro de automóvil, luego vuelve al asunto del préstamo del automóvil cuando tengas más tiempo para explorarlo.

Reducir tus pagos de alquiler o hipoteca

Se espera que menos personas puedan pagar su renta este mes, y los propietarios anticipan que la situación empeorará con el paso del verano. Si bien es posible que no puedas pagar el alquiler en este momento, hay mejores maneras de manejar la situación que simplemente no enviar el cheque de alquiler e ignorar al arrendador y esperar que él o ella lo olviden (consejo: eso no es probable que suceda).

En cambio, dedica otros 10 minutos para comunicarte con tu casero para explicar tu situación y ofrece pagar una parte de tu alquiler durante los próximos meses. Ofrecer incluso una renta parcial puede ser de gran ayuda para algunos propietarios, ya que muestra un esfuerzo por al menos hacer algún tipo de pago.

No solo pidas un mes. Solicita una reducción de la renta durante los próximos meses, para que no tengas que regresar y tratar de negociar una nueva renta cada mes. Comienza con una oferta baja y deja que tu arrendador te ofrezca una cifra más alta si es necesario. Si tu arrendador se resiste a darle alguna reducción de renta, sugiérele que pagar una tarifa más baja ahora y pagar parte de la renta faltante más adelante.

Una vez que llegues a un acuerdo, ponlo por escrito. Enviar un correo electrónico a su arrendador con los términos acordados después de enviar un mensaje de texto al respecto o hablar por teléfono será extremadamente útil en el futuro si hay un desacuerdo.

Y si su arrendador no está dispuesto a llegar a un acuerdo, eso no significa que puedas ser desalojado de inmediato. Varios estados cuentan con moratorias temporales de desalojo, e incluso cuando finalicen, el propietario debe pasar por un proceso legal para comenzar tu desalojo. Conocer tus derechos y tener documentación de tus esfuerzos de divulgación a tu arrendador será útil en cualquier caso.

Si eres dueño de tu casa, puedes llamar a tu agente hipotecario y solicitar que se difieran tus pagos mensuales. Esto se llama “indulgencia”, y los propietarios pueden obtener una indulgencia de hasta un año gracias a la Ley CARES que el Congreso aprobó en marzo.

La buena noticia es que, de conformidad con la Ley CARES, si tu hipoteca califica para este supuesto, no solo no tienes que hacer los pagos de su hipoteca durante un año, sino que tampoco acumularás ningún interés o tarifa adicional en tu préstamo durante ese período.

La mala noticia es que aún tendrás que hacer esos pagos eventualmente, no son perdonados. Algunos bancos incluso los están agregando al final del período de tolerancia como una suma global, lo que te dejaría una factura enorme en quizás solo un año o varios meses a partir de ahora.

Pero como todo, puede ser negociable. “La tolerancia no es única para todos, y hay diferentes opciones de pago”, dice Viral Shah, jefe de productos financieros de Better.com, un prestamista hipotecario directo. “Los propietarios deben preguntar a sus prestamistas sobre las diferentes formas de planes de pago, incluida una modificación del préstamo, como mantener los pagos mensuales consistentes y agregar los pagos perdidos del prestatario al final de la hipoteca”.

Incluso una tolerancia con una suma global es probablemente mejor que el incumplimiento de tus pagos ahora. Por lo tanto, llama a tu banco o contacta con él en línea y mira lo que pueden ofrecer.

Finalmente, puedes considerar refinanciar su hipoteca y reducir su pago mensual de esa manera. “Los propietarios pueden potencialmente ahorrar cientos de dólares al mes refinanciando ahora”, dice Shah. “El costo de los préstamos nunca ha sido más barato para los propietarios de viviendas, ya que las tasas a 30 años se han desplomado a un mínimo histórico”.

Incluso podrías obtener efectivo por tu propiedad al mismo tiempo. “Un refinanciamiento en efectivo es una forma de refinanciar su hipoteca y aprovechar el valor neto de tu hogar”, explica Shah. “Con un refinanciamiento en efectivo, obtendrás efectivo después del cierre. El préstamo generalmente tiene una tasa fija, a diferencia de una línea de crédito con garantía hipotecaria, que a menudo tiene una tasa variable”.

Pero un refinanciamiento hipotecario definitivamente no es un proceso corto: el tiempo promedio que demora en la industria hipotecaria desde la solicitud hasta el cierre es de 42 días. También necesitarás poder mostrar un ingreso estable para calificar, lo que puede ser imposible si has perdido su trabajo recientemente. Así que quédate con las opciones de tolerancia si necesita reducir sus gastos rápidamente.

Deshazte de esos costes ocultos de entretenimiento

Probablemente pienses que, dado que muchas tiendas y locales están cerrados, ya has reducido sus gastos de entretenimiento. Y eso es indudablemente cierto. Pero hay una serie de costes que aún pueden estar al acecho en su presupuesto.

Aquí está la tercera de tus tareas de 10 minutos: mira el extracto de tu tarjeta de crédito y débito y encuentra todas esas pequeñas tarifas de suscripción mensual molestas. ¿Puedes vivir un tiempo sin gastar $13 al mes en Birchbox o $1.99 en OneDrive de Microsoft? ¿Y realmente necesita una entrega de calcetines nuevos cada mes?

Esos pequeños costos mensuales suman, y hay una buena posibilidad de que no los estés utilizando todos activamente. Cancélalos ahora, y siempre puedes reiniciarlos una vez que la economía mejore. Muchas compañías podrán incluso ofrecer bonificaciones en el futuro para captar a los clientes que se fueron.

Y mientras hablamos de suscripciones, este es el momento de mirar esa factura mensual de cable o satélite. Incluso si no vas a renunciar a tu suscripción a TV para pasar el tiempo en casa, estas compañías a menudo están dispuestas a reducir tu factura si les hace saber que no estás en condiciones de seguir pagando una tarifa mensual tan alta.

Este concepto también puede extenderse a otras industrias. Por ejemplo, si está pagando $95 cada año por una tarjeta de crédito de viaje pero no puedes viajar en este momento, llama a tu emisor cuando venza la tarifa anual y explica que no puedes aprovechar la tarjeta. A menudo encontrarás que su emisor está dispuesto a renunciar a la tarifa anual o dejar algunos puntos o millas adicionales en su cuenta.

Concéntrate primero en estas tres grandes categorías de gastos

Puede ser más fácil reducir temporalmente los gastos en las áreas más grandes de tu presupuesto; es más probable que obtengas mayores ahorros por el tiempo que dedicas a ello. Pero incluso los pequeños ahorros pueden sumar si estás recortando gastos mensuales recurrentes como el seguro de un automóvil ahora que ya no conduces tanto o suscripciones que ya no usas.

Así que enfócate primero en los costes de tu automóvil, vivienda y entretenimiento, y encuentra dinero que puedas ahorrar en esas áreas antes de preocuparse por otras categorías. Solo ten en cuenta si realmente estás obteniendo una rebaja permanente o simplemente retrasando el pago para otro día. Ambas son medidas potencialmente sabias para ayudarte a superar la crisis actual, simplemente no te sorprendas si una gran factura se presentará más adelante en el segundo caso.

http://cnn.com,Nuestras primeras impresiones con las nuevas MacBook Pro,"Hemos pasado las últimas 48 horas con la última MacBook Pro. Lo hemos hecho, además, con dos modelos. El equipado con procesador Intel de 8ª generación i5, que es el modelo de entrada, y el equipado con un procesador de 10ª generación i5, que cuesta $1,799 en lugar de $1,299.

El precio es una diferencia clave, pero el procesador, la cantidad de RAM y el tamaño de almacenamiento también lo son.

La mayor diferencia con respecto a la generación anterior, sin embargo, es que cuentan con el Magic Keyboard. Ese es el mismo teclado que nos cautivó en la MacBook Pro de 16 pulgadas, la MacBook Air 2020 y el Magic Keyboard para iPad Pro. También hay el doble de almacenamiento, y en el caso de los modelos de gama alta, además de un mejor procesador, mejor memoria RAM.

Ambos todavía funcionan más rápido que la MacBook Air 2020, de ahí el apellido Pro, y verás aún más mejoras con el de $1,799, precisamente por estar impulsado por un Core i5 de 10ª generación.

Aquí está nuestra primera toma de contacto con estas nuevas MacBook Pros.

El Magic Keyboard sigue siendo mágico

El gran anuncio aquí es que el Magic Keyboard es estándar en ambos modelos. Es similar a la experiencia que tuvimos en la MacBook Pro de 16 pulgadas y la MacBook Air 2020, y bastante cerca del Magic Keyboard para iPad Pro (modelos de 11 y 12.9 pulgadas).

Es muy sensible, lo que lo hace muy cómodo para escribir. Tiene 1 milímetro de recorrido de tecla y hay un cierto retroceso con cada pulsación, pero no siente que las teclas toquen fondo.

Las teclas son resistentes y las esquinas están ligeramente elevadas con una pendiente gradual que va hacia el centro. Puedes encontrar fácilmente las teclas, e incluso una presión más cercana a una esquina se registra rápidamente.

Las tapas de las teclas son de plástico y se sienten bastante táctiles. Y como dijimos en la revisión de la MacBook Air de 2020, este no es un diseño de teclado estrecho. El Magic Keyboard de 13 pulgadas es el mismo que el de 16 pulgadas. Tiene un amplio espacio entre cada tecla: no tocamos accidentalmente teclas adyacentes.

La otra buena noticia es que la tecla ESC física ha regresado. Tiene el mismo ancho que otras teclas centrales y aproximadamente la mitad de la altura (por lo que es igual al ancho de la barra táctil). Es fácil de tocar y práctico tenerla siempre disponible.

Touch Bar tampoco se siente demasiado apretado, y proporciona acceso rápido a los accesos directos a aplicaciones. Es ideal para enviar mensajes de texto con fácil acceso a emojis. El lado derecho de la Touch Bar se complementa con el sensor Touch ID: la autenticación con desbloqueo, configuración de permisos y uso de Apple Pay fue rápida.

Potencia

Hay una diferencia en el rendimiento entre los modelos de $1,299 y $1,799.

Aunque ambos son más rápidos que la MacBook Air, hay una arquitectura diferente en cada uno: la MacBook Air usa la 10ª generación de procesadores Core i3, mientras que la MacBook Pro tiene un Core i5 de 8ª generación o un Core i5 de 10ª generación según el modelo escogido. Notamos una mejora en la velocidad en el segundo al probar el Asistente de Migración, realizar ediciones en Photoshop y exportar un archivo en iMovie, como cabría esperar, aunque no es una diferencia enorme.

También hay otros detalles que cambian entre los dos modelos. El de $1,799 tiene un chip más nuevo, que genera menos calor. El ventilador intervino menos y completó las tareas más rápido, desde abrir varias docenas de pestañas en Google Chrome hasta instalar Slack y ejecutar exportaciones de Photoshop. La experiencia general fue bastante buena.

Pero ambos pueden manejar tareas básicas cotidianas (estamos hablando de grandes exportaciones de Photoshop, creaciones de iMovie, juegos livianos e incluso fórmulas intensas). Notarás que estas tareas son más rápidas en el modelo Core i5 pero sobre todo porque se combina con el doble de RAM y es una RAM más rápida.

Hicimos trabajar al ventilador en ambos modelos, pero nunca llegó al punto en que estuviesen demasiado calientes para tocarlos.

Diseño familiar

Apple no ha cambiado mucho en términos de diseño, demostrando una vez más que si algo no está roto, no es necesario que lo arregles.

Todos los modelos de la MacBook Pro de 13 pulgadas todavía incluyen un trackpad de gran tamaño. Somos grandes admiradores de este trackpad: es ideal para gestos, arrastrar y soltar archivos y navegar entre varios monitores.

También obtendrás el mismo diseño unibody de aluminio; plata o gris espacial son las opciones de color. Vienen con un adaptador de corriente USB tipo C de 61 vatios y un cable de carga USB tipo C de 2 metros.

El modelo de $1,299 incluye solo dos puertos Thunderbolt 3 USB tipo C en el lado izquierdo, mientras que el lado derecho presenta el conector para auriculares. Hay cuatro puertos USB tipo C y Thunderbolt 3 en el modelo de $1,799, junto con un conector para auriculares.

La webcam sigue siendo el mismo modelo de 720p, lo que es un poco decepcionante. También seguimos esperando que Apple incluya Face ID y un sistema de cámara True Depth en Mac.

La pantalla Retina de 13.3 pulgadas es tan vibrante como siempre y es bastante brillante con 500 nits. Los profesionales creativos apreciarán que los colores se presenten de manera realista. Tampoco tiene problemas para mostrar imágenes que cuentan con colores brillantes y oscuros.

Nuestras impresiones

El nuevo teclado es definitivamente nuestra característica favorita después de 48 horas. La capacidad de respuesta de las teclas nos convence y creemos que escribir sobre ellas será una experiencia agradable. Estamos felices de que haya llegado por fin a la MacBook Pro de 13 pulgadas.

Los equipos son potentes y se han movido con soltura en nuestras pruebas y tareas. Notarás una mejora con respecto a la generación anterior con el modelo de $1,799 y ambos modelos nuevos son más rápidos que la MacBook Air.

Obtienes además el doble de almacenamiento en todos los puntos de precios (en comparación con el modelo anterior), y con el descuento educativo, estos cuestan solo $1,199 y $1,699, respectivamente.

Quienes busquen un buen regalo de graduación y los estudiantes que ingresan a la universidad en el otoño deben tomar nota. Incluso el modelo básico de $1,299 de 13 pulgadas te dará algo más de potencia que la MacBook Air, especialmente si vas a hacer edición de fotos, trabajar con grandes hojas de cálculo e incluso realizar tareas de diseño gráfico o renderizado.

http://cnn.com,"Si aún no tienes un timbre Ring, este puede ser un buen momento","Ring ha lanzado recientemente varios timbres con vídeo, sistemas de alarma y accesorios pero el anuncio de hoy es probablemente el más interesante. La compañía ha anunciado una actualización del Video Doorbell original a solo $99.99. Se puede reservar ya y estará disponible el 3 de junio.

Lo mejor de la nueva versión es el aumento en resolución de vídeo. Pasa de 720p a 1080p HD. Esto no solo te dará una vista más clara y nítida, sino que también mejorará la experiencia del usuario, especialmente cuando se considera que el dispositivo en el que lo estás viendo (como un iPhone o Android) tienen resolución de sobra para este tipo de vídeos. También obtendrá zooms digitales más claros ya que la calidad base es mayor.

El diseño es el mismo que el timbre original de Ring. La parte superior que alberga la cámara y los sensores es una mezcla entre un negro mate y brillante, mientras que la mitad inferior es plateada. El botón de anillo tiene un anillo LED incorporado que brillará en azul cuando suene. Un sutil logotipo de Ring está en la parte inferior.

El Video Doorbell de segunda generación también admite una configuración cableada, perfecto si desea reemplazar un timbre tradicional, pero puedes alimentarlo a través de la batería no extraíble (para cargar este modelo, debes quitar todo el timbre, que no es increíblemente complejo, pero es importante tener en cuenta).

Pero hay incluso una solución para esto. Ring lanzará en julio un cargador solar por $49 y podrá mantenerse conectado al timbre original para proporcionar energía las 24 horas, los 7 días de la semana.

El Ring Video Doorbell todavía presenta visión nocturna, la capacidad de designar zonas de privacidad y cuenta con conversación bidireccional. De esta forma puedes recibir alertas si alguien está en la puerta y acceder a la aplicación Ring para hablar con ellos.

A $99.99, este es el timbre de video más asequible de Ring y conserva las características más esenciales.

http://cnn.com,¿No puedes ir a la playa o al lago este año? Hora de poner una piscina en el jardín,"El clima comienza a calentarse y necesitas escapar d casa. Pero las piscinas públicas, las playas y los lagos puede que este año no abran, al menos en el corto plazo. Si tienes la suerte de tener un patio trasero o un espacio abierto, este puede ser el momento adecuado para considerar una piscina desmontable.

Si bien no son tan complicados como las piscinas en tierra, existen muchas consideraciones que hay que tener en cuenta, según Dan DiClerico, experto en viviendas de HomeAdvisor.

Tu espacio

En primer lugar, dice DiClerico, inspeccione el espacio que va a ocupar. “Asegúrese de que la piscina cabe en el patio sin violar las normas de edificación”, dice. Estas variarán según la comunidad dnde vivas, pero según él, las piscinas generalmente deben estar al menos a 5 pies de las líneas de propiedad y a cierta distancia de la casa principal, tal vez 12 o 15 pies. Además, la proximidad a las líneas eléctricas y los servicios públicos subterráneos es un factor, y muchas comunidades de vecinos (HOAs) requieren permisos para instalar una piscina.

“Debes repasar todas estas normas, verificando con su ayuntamiento y el departamento de construcción, antes de tomar cualquier tipo de decisión de compra”, aconseja DiClerico.

Una vez que hayas entendido la logística municipal, también debe considerar si tu paisaje es adecuado para una piscina. “¿Se inclina tu suelo o hay grandes árboles o rocas en el camino?” DiClerico dice. “Puede que tengas que pagar para que se eliminen o reubiquen”.

Y recuerda, algunas comunidades tienen códigos con respecto a la eliminación de árboles. La estabilidad del suelo también puede ser un factor, dependiendo del tamaño de la piscina que estéa considerando. “Si el suelo es muy blando y arenoso, es posible que deba enmendarlo antes de colocarlo en la piscina”, dice.

Seguro

Solo estamos siendo cautelosos aquí, pero la instalación de una piscina, incluso una sobre el suelo, puede afectar el seguro de los propietarios. Consulta con tu proveedor sobre la cobertura, restricciones y tarifas. “En general, los huéspedes de la casa están cubiertos por lesiones que pueden ocurrir mientras usan la piscina, pero la piscina en sí no está cubierta por ningún daño que pueda ocurrir”, dice DiClerico. “Muchos proveedores requerirán que coloque una cerca protectora o una puerta a prueba de niños antes de siquiera considerar la cobertura”.

El coste de una piscina

“La ventaja obvia de las piscinas sobre el suelo sobre el suelo es el coste”, dice DiClerico. De acuerdo con la Guía de costes reales de HomeAdvisor, la mayoría de las personas gastan entre $1,000 y $4,000 en piscinas elevadas, $2,500 en promedio, en comparación con un promedio de $50,000 para una piscina enterrada, cuyos costes pueden llegar fácilmente a las seis cifras si agregan elementos de lujo, características como una bañera de hidromasaje o una cascada.

Para una piscina sobre el suelo hasta aproximadamente $1,000, limitarán su tamaño y forma. “Por $1,000, no obtendrá más que una piscina redonda básica de 12 pies con cero complementos o accesorios”, dice DiClerico. “A medida que aumentas el precio, las piscinas se hacen más grandes y de forma más diversas, incluidas las rectangulares, ovales y hexagonales”. Las opciones sobre el suelo más grandes y de mayor nivel, que miden cerca de 20 por 40 pies, costarán alrededor de $4,500.

¿Y cuánto necesitas gastar? DiClerico recomienda pensar en cómo quieres usar la piscina. “Si solo quieres un lugar personal para relajarte y refrescarte, una básica servirá”, dice. “Si lo desesa para entretener o para que jueguen los niños, necesitarás una piscina más grande, con una cubierta circundante para descansar y características de seguridad adicionales, que incluyen una cerca o una escalera extraíble para evitar que los niños accedan a la piscina cuando no podemos vigilarlos”.

A medida que calculas tu presupuesto, ten en cuenta algunos de los complementos (kits de piscina, revestimiento, lados, bordes, bomba y escalera) pueden aumentar el precio total.

El trabajo

Los costos anteriores no incluyen la instalación, que, si contratas a un profesional para que lo haga puede costarle más de $1,000, informa DiClerico. Si eres aficionado al bricolaje puedes encargarte la instalación con la ayuda de algunos amigos, posiblemente en unas pocas horas o un día, dependiendo del tamaño y el alcance de la piscina.

Decide de antemano si desea que otra persona haga la instalación y pregunta por adelantado sobre los términos y los costes.

Complementos

La bomba y filtro sobre el suelo necesitarán electricidad para funcionar. DiClerico dice que necesitará una línea dedicada de 110V / 20 amperios, y la piscina debe estar conectada y conectada a tierra; consulta con el fabricante de la piscina y consulta a un electricista si es necesario, para asegurarse de que todas sus conexiones estén seguras y conformes con el código de construcción de tu zona.

Extras

Si vas a por una piscina más grande y más cara, o si tienes más presupuesto, es posible que desee invertir en algunas características adicionales. “La iluminación es una actualización muy valiosa, porque te permite disfrutar de la piscina en las calurosas noches de verano”, señala DiClerico.

Ahora hay opciones de iluminación subacuática y flotante que agregan un poco de fantasía. Un calentador es otra actualización que gusta bastante, ya que extiende el tiempo de uso de la piscina en climas con cuatro estaciones.

Piscinas de menos de $500

“A este precio, hablamos de piscinas inflables, como piscinas de niños pero para adultos”, dice DiClerico. “Son asequibles y muy fáciles de instalar, pero no se consideran una solución permanente”.

Eso significa que al final de la temporada, deberás desinflar y almacenar la piscina. Y ten cuidado con los objetos afilados, incluidas las rocas pequeñas expulsadas por el cortacésped, que podrían causar daños permanentes a una opción menos costosa.

Estos también son los grupos que se venden más rápido, por lo que nos aseguraremos de actualizar esta lista regularmente.

http://cnn.com,El área metropolitana de Miami apunta a reabrir el 18 de mayo,"Miami-Dade y la ""nueva normalidad"" por el covid-19 5:02

(CNN Español) — El alcalde del condado Miami-Dade, Carlos Giménez, dijo que planea comenzar la reapertura del área metropolitana de la ciudad el 18 de mayo. Giménez indicó que, en una primera fase, este proceso se hará en conjunto con el gobernador de Florida, Ron DeSantis.

“Necesitamos que la economía vuelva a funcionar, y de la manera más segura posible”, indicó el edil en una conferencia de prensa virtual.

Giménez aseguró que el proceso probablemente será similar al de los 64 condados que ya han reabierto, donde los restaurantes funcionan a un 25% de su capacidad por dentro y a un 50% por fuera, aunque señaló que intentará estudiar una cifra más alta con el gobernador DeSantis. Sobre los comercios no esenciales, dijo que podrían funcionar a un 50% de capacidad, siempre y cuando se respete el distanciamiento social.

Si bien no especificó con claridad qué tipo de negocios podrán abrir el 18 de mayo, el jefe del condado Miami-Dade afirmó que “casi todos los comercios tendrán las mismas reglas”.

Sí insistió en que cines y discotecas seguirán cerrados, al igual que spas y peluquerías, aunque en el caso de estas últimas, se comprometió a buscar algún tipo de alternativa en conjunto con el estado.

Giménez también dejó en claro que cada ciudad puede reservarse el derecho de no reabrir: “Las ciudades pueden ser más estrictas que Miami-Dade, pero no pueden ser menos estrictas”.

“A medida que comencemos a avanzar hacia una nueva normalidad y a abrir negocios en el futuro, me aseguraré de que haya personas mayores y que cualquier persona en riesgo esté protegida”, precisó.

Menos contagios, más pruebas

El alcalde metropolitano indicó que el jueves (mayo 7) se sumaron 582 nuevos infectados en el condado, “la cifra más baja desde el 4 de abril pasado”. Esos números son los que sustentan la idea de apuntar lo antes posible a lo que Giménez llamó “la nueva normalidad”.

Asimismo, dijo que ya hay dos centros disponibles para que los niños mayores de 12 años sin síntomas puedan ir a hacerse el examen. Insistió en que los hospitales están a un 20% de su capacidad y llamó a las comunidades de migrantes y a las de menores ingresos a hacerse la prueba del covid-19 gratuita.

Situación de asilos

Consultado por CNN sobre la disparidad de números de muertos y contagios en los asilos de ancianos en Florida, Giménez no quiso entrar en la controversia y evitó polemizar con el estado. Se limitó a decir que firmó esta semana una orden ejecutiva para obligar a los establecimientos para ancianos a entregar la información diariamente. “Tenemos más de mil asilos en Miami-Dade. Estoy seguro de que algunos no cumplen, pero no he recibido quejas de los familiares”, afirmó.

Tras otra consulta de CNN, Giménez negó que desde el condado haya habido quejas al estado por la asignación de recursos al área metropolitana de Miami, el área con mayor número de casos

de contagiados en todo Florida. En este estado, ya se han registrado 39.199 casos y 1.669 muertos, según el Departamento de Salud de Florida."
http://cnn.com,"Un hombre de Albuquerque encontró US$ 135.000 al lado de un cajero automático y en lugar de llevárselos, llamó a la Policía","Funcionarios de Albuquerque celebraron la decisión de José Núñez. Aquí aparece con una placa presentada por el jefe de policía Mike Geier. Están rodeados por los padres de Núñez, Carmen Romaniz y José Núñez Juárez.

(CNN) — José Núñez Romaniz tenía la misión de comprar calcetines para su abuelo. Acababa de ayudarlo a encontrar los correctos en Internet, después de que el anciano no pudiera encontrarlos en en las tiendas físicas.

Nuñez, de 19 años, solo necesitaba depositar dinero en su cuenta bancaria para realizar la compra por Internet. Cuando fue a hacer el depósito, hizo un descubrimiento sorprendente, y lo que hizo a continuación le valió elogios y un poco de fama en la ciudad más poblada de Nuevo México.

Nuñez condujo hasta un cajero automático afuera de una sucursal bancaria de Wells Fargo el domingo por la mañana a solo dos minutos de su casa en Albuquerque para hacer el depósito.

Mientras estacionaba su camioneta junto al cajero, vio una bolsa de plástico transparente en el suelo. Era una “pila de 30 centímetros” de billetes de US$ 50 y US$ 20, dijo.

“No sabía qué hacer. Estaba soñando”, le dijo Nuñez a CNN. “Estaba en estado de shock. Estaba mirándome a mí mismo y solo pensaba: ‘¿Qué debo hacer?'”.

Nuñez dijo que nunca consideró quedarse con el efectivo, pero todo tipo de pensamientos salvajes pasaron por su mente. ¿Era esto algún tipo de truco? ¿Alguien iba a detenerse detrás de él y secuestrarlo?

Con el banco cerrado ese domingo, Nuñez llamó a la Policía de Albuquerque. Llegaron dos agentes y el joven entregó el dinero.

Los policías contaron el dinero en efectivo en la estación: un total de US$ 135.000.

La Policía de Albuquerque entiende que el dinero fue dejado por error fuera del cajero automático por un subcontratista del banco que estaba destinado a suministrar efectivo a la máquina, dijo el policía Simon Drobik.

“Este dinero podría haber hecho una increíble diferencia en su vida si hubiera tomado el otro camino, pero eligió … el camino de la integridad e hizo lo correcto”, dijo Drobik, portavoz de la policía de Albuquerque.

Cuando se le pidió un comentario sobre las acciones de Nuñez este jueves, el portavoz de Wells Fargo, Tony Timmons, le dijo a CNN que se remitiera al proveedor que presta servicios a los cajeros automáticos.

CNN ha dejado un mensaje a ese proveedor en busca de comentarios.

‘Escuchaba las lecciones de sus padres en su cabeza’

Nuñez, un estudiante universitario que vive en casa y ayuda a sus padres a cuidar a sus dos hermanos menores, dijo que su familia proviene de “orígenes humildes”, y que nadie de su familia ha estado cerca o ha visto toda esa cantidad de dinero.

El hombre dijo que mientras miraba el dinero en efectivo, esperando que llegaran los policías, podía escuchar las lecciones de sus padres en su cabeza.

“Mis padres siempre me enseñaron a trabajar por mi cuenta. El dinero robado nunca te duraría, en ningún momento”, recordó Núñez sobre lo que su madre y su padre le habían enseñado.

Y para Nuñez, que proviene de una familia latina muy unida, había una fuerza que lo guiaba a portarse bien.

“Tenía la voz de mi madre y su ‘chancla’ en la parte posterior de mi cabeza”, dijo Nuñez. “La chancla” es una referencia a una amenaza a menudo real, a menudo humorística, de un azote con una chancla para mantener a los niños en el camino correcto.

José ha recibido algunos regalos de empresas

La integridad de Nuñez no quedó sin recompensa.

Funcionarios de la ciudad festejaron este jueves una ceremonia en honor a Nuñez afuera de la Academia de Policía de Albuquerque.

El jefe de Policía le entregó una placa e invitó a Nuñez, un estudiante de la Universidad Comunitaria del Centro de Nuevo México que tiene la intención de estudiar justicia penal, a solicitar un trabajo como asistente de servicio público en el Departamento de Policía, dijo Drobik.

ESPN Radio 101,7 FM de Albuquerque le entregó algunos recuerdos deportivos firmados que tenía en la estación, incluido un balón de fútbol autografiado por el exdefensa de la NFL y de la Universidad de Nuevo México Brian Urlacher.

La estación de radio le dio seis boletos para la temporada para el fútbol de la UNM, dijo el presidente de la estación, Joe O’Neill, quien había escuchado sobre la historia de Nuñez de un conocido de la Policía.

Y al menos tres negocios locales le entregaron a Nuñez US$ 500 cada uno, y uno de ellos, un restaurante, agregó una tarjeta de regalo de US$ 100, dijo O’Neill.

“Es la historia más genial… es increíble lo que hizo este chico”, dijo O’Neill.

En una entrevista con la estación de radio el jueves por la noche, Nuñez agradeció a las empresas y funcionarios que asistieron al evento y les dijo a los oyentes lo que ocurrió ese domingo. Recordó que la Policía llegó “en cinco minutos” después de que llamó.

Y sí, terminó lo que había comenzado para su abuelo.

“Regresé a casa y terminé mis compras en línea”, dijo.

Su madre está orgullosa

Los padres de Nuñez emigraron de México a fines de la década de 1990. Una vez trabajaron en campos agrícolas recogiendo cebollas. Su padre también pasó años trabajando como lavaplatos, cocinero y en construcción. Ahora la familia opera un pequeño negocio de venta de colchones.

Nuñez acaba de terminar su primer año universitario. Su sueño de la infancia es trabajar como investigador de escenas del crimen.

Nuñez dijo que llamó a su madre justo después de contactar a la Policía el domingo. Los policías de Albuquerque fueron a la casa de la familia y elogiaron a sus padres.

“Ella me dijo que hice lo correcto y que estaba orgullosa de mí”, dijo Nuñez. “Me llamó y casi comenzó a llorar”."

http://cnn.com,"La vida nunca será la misma después de que pase la pandemia, dice periodista de salud pública","ONU: covid-19 eliminará avances en la igualdad de género 5:30

(CNN) — En los años posteriores al coronavirus, nada será como antes, dijo este jueves la periodista de salud pública ganadora del premio Pulitzer Laurie Garrett.



“Creo que en unos cuatro o cinco años a partir de ahora no habrá un solo aspecto de nuestras vidas que no haya cambiado”, dijo en en un foro de CNN sobre coronavirus. “Es casi imposible imaginar completamente cómo se verá”.

MIRA: ¿Cuánto tiempo podría durar la pandemia de coronavirus en EE.UU.?

La mayoría de los estados en EE. UU. están eliminando gradualmente las restricciones establecidas para frenar la propagación del coronavirus. Y mientras las empresas vuelven a abrir lentamente, un modelo influyente citado a menudo por la Casa Blanca ha dicho que el número de muertos por el virus podría superar los 130.000 en agosto. Mientras tanto, algunos líderes locales han dicho que sus comunidades no están listas para relajar las restricciones.

La falta de un enfoque unificado para abordar la pandemia puede causar problemas para erradicar el virus, incluso con una vacuna, dijo Garrett.

“El virus continuará circulando en el mundo, independientemente de si hay una vacuna o no, a menos que estemos comprometidos con un objetivo estratégico de eliminar realmente el virus del planeta con la implementación adecuada de la vacuna para todos: 7.500 millones de seres humanos”.

A medida que la duración y la amplitud de los efectos del coronavirus se vuelven más claras, los estadounidenses pueden reconsiderar los aspectos cotidianos de la vida: desde los viajes aéreos hasta las reuniones que involucran el contacto humano, dijo.

“Todo tipo de interacciones y comportamientos que hemos dado por sentado se verán diferentes”, dijo Garrett. “Todavía no hemos sentido realmente el efecto de la gran depresión hacia la que nos dirigimos”.

Garrett contradijo la evaluación del vicepresidente Mike Pence de que la pandemia terminará en gran medida a fines de mayo, diciendo que para ella el plazo se acerca a unos 36 meses.

ONU: covid-19 eliminará avances en la igualdad de género 5:30

Ella atribuyó el cronograma de Pence al objetivo de la Casa Blanca de reiniciar la economía y abrir negocios, pero ya predice que la economía sentirá los efectos de esta pandemia durante años.

Cuando terminen los problemas de salud, dijo, es posible que los gobiernos no puedan invertir en el cambio y que las empresas no tengan los fondos suficientes para desarrollar e innovar, explicó.

Gary Cohn, exasesor económico del presidente Trump, enfatizó este jueves que es optimista sobre el futuro de la economía estadounidense y cree que la nación será “muy inteligente y muy creativa” para crear nuevas oportunidades, pero también dijo que no está de acuerdo con la evaluación del presidente de que el año que viene será increíble económicamente.

“Creo que nos llevará más de 12 meses evolucionar hasta donde nos sentimos cómodos”, dijo Cohn a Erin Burnett de CNN. “A menos de que ocurra algo milagrosamente en el campo de la medicina y recibamos una vacuna… tomará tiempo”.

Nota del editor: Xavier Serbiá es presentador de CNN Dinero, el programa de CNN en Español que entrega el rápido mundo de la economía y los negocios de una forma simple, inteligente y bien informada.

(CNN Español) – Pocos pensaban –al principio– que en la epidemia de covid-19 las autoridades ordenarían el cierre de comercios, lugares públicos y que enviarían a la gente a casa para frenar la expansión del coronavirus.

Y menos en una economía como la estadounidense, abierta y en la que el consumo es el motor.

¿Las consecuencias? Millones de personas han solicitado seguro de desempleo; hay millones de comercios cerrados que, junto con los gobiernos locales, intentan frenar la bancarrota.

Y todo esto ha tenido un gran impacto en el gasto del consumidor, en el ingreso y en la estabilidad de la economía personal.

Lo cierto es que, de una cachetada, la realidad nos bajó de “La La Land”.

¿Qué hacer? El que sigue trabajando y cuyo negocio no ha sido afectado, que esté alerta y que no tiente a la suerte.

El que no está en esa situación, más fácil le sería retroceder en el tiempo a los días previos al coronavirus para poder establecer los dos primeros estadios del manejo de una crisis: evitarla y prepararse para ella. Pero ese tren ya pasó.

Entonces tenemos que concentrarnos en los siguientes cuatro estadios, a los que llamo las “4R”:

1. Reconocimiento

Reconocer es enfrentar los hechos como son y no pintarlos con exceso de optimismo ni de pesimismo. Es ponerse el sombrero de científico y ver dónde está el problema y evaluar cuál es el nivel de gravedad.

Ante la pérdida de ingreso, tenemos dos retos: de dónde va a provenir el dinero para mantenernos a flote y cómo pagamos las deudas.

En finanzas hay dos pilares clave: liquidez y solvencia.

El primero tiene que ver con el dinero disponible –sin tener que recurrir a otros activos o préstamos– para cubrir las necesidades a corto plazo (12 meses o menos). La pregunta crucial aquí es: ¿cuánto dinero tengo disponible para cubrir los gastos operativos del negocio o del hogar por los próximos 30, 60, 90, 120 y hasta 360 días?

El segundo es qué activos, en caso de necesidad de dinero, están disponibles para la venta o para usarlos de prenda, a fin de cubrir la falta de liquidez.

En ambos casos hay que hacer un inventario de lo que se tiene, de lo que se debe y de lo que se gasta para determinar el grado de liquidez y solvencia en la economía personal o del negocio.

Cuando se hace la radiografía encontraremos diferentes grados de problemas. Habrá un grupo que podrá afrontar la crisis sin problema porque sus niveles de liquidez y solvencia son altos. Otros, podrán afrontarla por cierto tiempo. Otros podrán aguantar solo 30 días. Otros no tienen nada.

2. Respuesta

Aquí hay que hacer dos cosas: responder a lo urgente e importante y contener la crisis para que no se complique.

Lo urgente e importante es hallar el dinero que cubra los gastos mensuales necesarios para sobrevivir y pagar el servicio de la deuda. Desde buscar dinero disponible, utilizar lo que se tiene ahorrado, recortar gastos, vender lo que se tiene –última opción y si hay compradores-, utilizar crédito –la menos recomendable– o una mezcla de todas.

Hay que bajar los gastos operativos al mínimo tolerable, tanto en el negocio como en la casa. Eso puede ayudar a ganar tiempo hasta que se normalicen los ingresos.

Opciones de ingreso en EE.UU.: el cheque de estímulo, el seguro de desempleo, el préstamo PPP o de ayuda a pequeñas empresas y ver qué otras opciones te presenta el Estado. También están las cuentas por cobrar.

Sobre el pago de las deudas, hay que hablar con los acreedores para atrasar el pago de forma legal. Tienes el “forbearance” o aplazamiento de pago como una opción. Aunque no es una condonación y al final hay que pagarlo, al menos reduce la presión en el flujo de caja.

Sobre los préstamos estudiantiles puedes dejar de pagarlos por un tiempo.

Si tienes cuentas de retiro privado tienes opción de sacar dinero.

3. Resolver

Acción, ejecución y obtener resultados. Aquí el que se cansa, el que tira la toalla, pierde. Llamarás y te pasarás horas en el teléfono. Te frustrarás. Solo recuerda que son millones en situaciones similares.

Si te amenazan con desalojarte de tu vivienda alquilada, busca la ley Estatal que corresponda, ya que muy probablemente tengas protección por un tiempo. Habla con el casero, explica la situación y negocia.

Si es casa propia y el problema es la hipoteca, averigua si tu préstamo está respaldado por el gobierno federal. Por la ley CARES tienes hasta 180 días de aplazamiento más 180 días de extensión. Los bancos están concediendo aplazamiento por un tiempo.

Otra opción es refinanciar o sacar una línea de crédito sobre el patrimonio. Toma en cuenta los pros y los contras.

Aunque usar las tarjetas no es la mejor opción –hay altos intereses y es más deuda–, he visto que a algunos negocios los ha sacado de aprietos de forma temporal. Solo recuerda que el dinero mal utilizado no borra que es dinero prestado – aumentando el inventario de deuda– y que tendrás que pagarlo.

4. Revisión

Mientras vas resolviendo lo urgente e importante, toma nota de los errores y aciertos que veas en el camino. Cuando el calvario pase, es necesario que te sientes con tu familia y tus socios y revises fríamente dónde se equivocaron y cómo prepararse para evitar lo que se pueda evitar, para estar listo para lo que pueda venir. Porque las crisis llegarán. Con diferente traje y escenario, pero no dejarán de llegar.

Decía el filósofo George Santayana que aquellos que no recuerdan el pasado están condenados a repetirlo.

Esta es otra oportunidad para aprender porque, aunque la historia no se repite, a menudo rima."

No están contentos con eso.,"Nota del editor: Nancy Darling es profesora de psicología en Oberlin College, editora en jefe del Journal of Adolescence y fundadora de 1step2life, ltd, una aplicación que brinda apoyo a los adolescentes con dolor crónico y sus cuidadores. Su blog, Thinking About Kids, es publicado por Psychology Today. Las opiniones expresadas en este comentario son propias de la autora. Ver más opiniones en CNNE.com/opinion.

(CNN) — ¿Conoces el meme del grupo de adolescentes que están todos juntos, mirando sus pantallas? Ha vuelto a la vida. Muchos en la Clase de 2020, entre el primer grupo de nativos digitales, se graduarán en línea este mes.

No están contentos con eso.

Como profesora, he visto ese momento en el que los estudiantes de último año recuerdan que se van a graduar sin una ceremonia formal. No habrá un adiós con sus compañeros de laboratorio y compañeros de cuarto; no hay un último paseo por las aulas o el patio del campus; no hay grandes fiestas y no hay momentos finales con amigos.

Sucedió nuevamente el otro día. Max Kramer, uno de nuestros graduandos, había presentado su tesis, en línea, por supuesto. Después de su exposición, conversamos sobre los próximos pasos.

Luego mencioné la palabra “graduación”.

De repente, su voz se volvió temblorosa y sus ojos miraron a todas partes, menos a la cámara. “No me puedo imaginar”, dijo, antes de irse.

Las culturas crean rituales como ceremonias de graduación para guiarnos a través de los principales eventos de la vida. Unen a la clase vistiéndolas con gorras y batas, mientras reconocen los logros individuales de los estudiantes al leer (o imprimir) sus nombres. Los graduados literalmente caminan por el escenario y, con un movimiento de una borla, se mueven de una fase de su vida a otra.

Excepto este año.

Ni los eventos tradicionales de graduación ni ninguno de los libros que he leído proporcionan orientación sobre la transición durante una pandemia. Así que pasemos a lo básico y hablemos sobre lo que sabemos, sobre pasar por las transiciones en tiempos difíciles.

Un principio básico de la psicología del desarrollo es que las pequeñas diferencias se magnifican durante los tiempos de cambio rápido y cuando hay muchos caminos potenciales hacia adelante. En el curso normal de las cosas, los resultados para aquellos que siguen la corriente y aquellos que planifican activamente no son tan diferentes. Por el contrario, cuando todo cambia rápidamente, como cuando terminas la escuela en medio de una pandemia, es probable que las pequeñas diferencias en la forma en que responden las personas tengan consecuencias significativas a largo plazo.

Es como conducir en una carretera resbaladiza. Imagina que estás en el camino, ansioso pero más o menos en control. Todo está bien hasta que llegas a una curva y necesitas cambiar de dirección. De repente, un pequeño toque en el volante tiene un gran efecto en el camino que tomará tu automóvil. El movimiento equivocado, y tu automóvil estará en una zanja.

¿Cómo llegas de manera segura por este camino?

Generación resiliencia

En las últimas semanas, he leído mucho sobre resiliencia. Personalmente, no quiero que me llamen “resiliente”. Así te llaman cuando suceden cosas realmente malas, y logras mantener tu cabeza fuera del agua. Sin embargo, están sucediendo cosas malas, por lo que, si te estás graduando en medio de una pandemia, fomentar la resiliencia es tu mejor opción para sobrevivir.

Aquí hay un método de cinco pasos para llegar allí:

1. Haz un balance. Muchos graduandos comienzan su búsqueda de trabajo enumerando sus experiencias y creando un currículum.

Paso atrás. Una variedad de empresas y plataformas de búsqueda de empleo recomiendan centrarse en las habilidades que tiene, en lugar de los cursos que ha tomado, la especialización que ha completado o incluso su experiencia laboral. Estos pueden ser técnicos, como la escritura, las estadísticas, el diseño digital o los idiomas, o pueden ser habilidades interpersonales como cumplir con los plazos, priorizar tareas, atención al detalle o alfabetización cultural.

El trabajo académico y la experiencia solo son importantes en la medida en que le hayan dado habilidades transferibles. Tu primera tarea es hacer un balance de lo que sabes y convertir esos puntos del currículum en una lista explícita de habilidades que un empleador potencial puede usar.

2. Comunicarse de manera efectiva. La gente responde a las historias. Según el psicólogo Jerome Bruner, es posible que tengamos hasta 22 veces más probabilidades de recordar un conjunto de hechos presentados como una narración, que los hechos solos. Tu currículum, carta de presentación, portafolio en línea y presencia en las redes sociales deben comunicar un sentido coherente de quién eres como persona y contar una historia memorable sobre lo que puedes hacer.

Cuando cuentes tu historia, concéntrate en la audiencia. Facilita a los empleadores ver cómo puedes ayudarlos a lograr sus objetivos. Para hacer esto con éxito, comienza por pensar en las necesidades de la persona que realiza la contratación. Un principio central del emprendimiento es comenzar por encontrar lo que el cliente quiere y entregarlo, en lugar de construir algo y luego buscar un cliente. Hay un empleador por ahí que te necesita. Es tu trabajo encontrarlos.

Un enfoque efectivo es escribir perfiles de empleadores potenciales específicos. Concéntrate en sus necesidades básicas y puntos críticos: los elementos esenciales absolutos que harán o desharán una aplicación. Luego, piensa en qué más quiere ese empleador específico y ayúdalos a ver cómo puedes cumplir y superar sus expectativas.

Por ejemplo, una de mis alumnas quiere ser guionista. Perfiló el trabajo de sus sueños, escribir para una serie de televisión, y describió otros trabajos que serían primeros pasos realistas hacia ese objetivo, como trabajar como asistente de producción. Luego enumeró lo que podía hacer para satisfacer las necesidades básicas de los empleadores. Finalmente, expuso los atributos que agregan valor, esas cualidades que distinguen a un bien de un gran empleado.

Por ejemplo, como estudiante de psicología, tenía fuertes habilidades estadísticas. Cualquiera que busque un trabajo como guionista puede escribir. La mayoría de ellos no pueden escribir sobre números. Al destacar sus habilidades cuantitativas de una manera que mostraba cómo se aplicaban en ese entorno, creó detonadores que hacen que sea más fácil para un posible empleador ver el beneficio de contratarla sobre otro candidato.

3. Construir activos. Tienes habilidades: un conjunto de activos. Mientras buscas listados de trabajo, toma nota de las habilidades que los empleadores buscan y las palabras que usan para describirlos. Asegúrate de usar esas mismas palabras en tu currículum para que aparezcas en los motores de búsqueda. Si no los tienes ahora, este paréntesis es un buen momento para construirlos.

El voluntariado también puede ser especialmente valioso en este momento. Muchas organizaciones de caridad lo necesitan, desde bancos de alimentos hasta refugios de animales. El voluntariado muestra su valor e iniciativa. Y te hará sentir bien tanto mental como físicamente.

El voluntariado también puede ser excelente para tu carrera (incipiente). Brinda oportunidades para usar y desarrollar tus habilidades. Además, el voluntariado te ayuda a salir y hacer algo. Cada persona que conoces tiene una red social que puede ayudarte a encontrar trabajo.

¿Todavía en el encierro? Sé creativo. ¿Cuáles son tus habilidades en línea y en las redes sociales? La búsqueda de contactos, la tutoría, las líneas de ayuda y la prestación de servicios a las personas vulnerables son necesidades que pueden cumplir los voluntarios que trabajan de forma remota.

4. Sé flexible. Las habilidades que tienes se pueden aplicar en muchos lugares diferentes. Sin embargo, debido a que las oportunidades son muy pocas, es posible que tengas que pensar creativamente para encontrar esa coincidencia entre las necesidades de un empleador y su conjunto de habilidades. Experimenté eso en mi propia carrera. Graduándome durante una recesión, apliqué las habilidades que había desarrollado como arquitecta de interiores, haciendo malabares con los detalles, gestionando datos complejos y manteniendo a los contratistas en estrictos horarios, a un trabajo como asistente editorial de una revista científica. Finalmente, eso llevó a una carrera en investigación psicológica.

5. Reconoce los límites de lo que puedes hacer. Es difícil recordar que hay cosas que simplemente no puedes controlar. No te castigues porque tu transición al mercado laboral no va bien. Concentra tu energía en hacer lo mejor que puedas en la situación en la que te encuentras.

Tengo un estudiante que realmente ejemplifica este enfoque. Cuando comenzó el semestre, Zach Arfa se estaba preparando para salir al mercado laboral. Tiene un currículum impresionante, complementado por una cartera excepcional que muestra sus habilidades. Solicitó puestos como activista ambiental y organizador comunitario. Entonces la pandemia golpeó. En este punto, todos esos empleadores le respondieron que, dada la incertidumbre de los tiempos, no están contratando en este momento.

Pero tengo fe de que va a superar esto, porque es resistente. Se ha aprovechado de todos los recursos que pudo encontrar. No solo se inscribió en el taller que ofrecimos para construir una marca personal fuerte, sino que llamó a la presentadora y le pidió que criticara y refinara su currículum y su presencia en línea. Participó en una incubadora de emprendimiento para financiar una organización sin fines de lucro que había ayudado a construir. Al hacerlo, consolidó su valor para esa organización, aprendió nuevas habilidades y se presentó a una red de antiguos alumnos poderosos.

Identificó a las personas con las que quería trabajar y les preguntó cómo podía prepararse para los puestos en sus organizaciones. Hacerlo le dio la oportunidad de discutir sus antecedentes y habilidades y mostrar su iniciativa sin hacer una solicitud directa de trabajo.

Ser resistente no significa que esté pasando un momento fácil, todavía no tiene trabajo. Tampoco significa que necesariamente lo hará tan bien en unos pocos años como lo habría hecho si se hubiera graduado con la Clase de 2019, cuando EE.UU. tenía un desempleo del 3,6%. Pero su compromiso de tomar medidas significativas mejora las posibilidades de que supere esto. Ese tipo de ventaja pequeña puede hacer una gran diferencia a largo plazo.

La resiliencia es una cualidad ambiental

Es importante recordar que la resiliencia no es solo una cualidad de la persona, sino también una cualidad del medio ambiente. Y los colegios y universidades pueden ayudar a fomentar la resiliencia. Además de enumerar trabajos y organizar ferias de carreras, tanto la facultad como las oficinas de servicios de carreras pueden ayudar a los estudiantes a escribir y pulir sus currículums y cartas de presentación. Muchas oficinas de servicio profesional también pueden trabajar con graduados para practicar habilidades de entrevista reales y virtuales y pulir su presencia telefónica.

También pueden ayudar a los estudiantes de último año de la universidad a acceder a redes de antiguos alumnos a través de servicios como Handshake. Los recién graduados pueden proporcionar perspectiva y consejos prácticos, y los alumnos más antiguos también pueden brindar oportunidades para establecer contactos.

Si tu institución no ofrece el servicio que deseas, pregunta. Por ejemplo, solicita una sesión en LinkedIn, un taller sobre cómo crear una marca personal o una sesión sobre cómo iluminarse y vestirse para el éxito en Zoom. Los servicios profesionales a menudo están ansiosos por ayudar, ya que tu éxito es lo que los hace verse bien.

Los padres también pueden fomentar la resiliencia. Este es un momento difícil para los padres, ya que muchos experimentan orgullo por el logro de sus graduados, ambivalencia acerca de que los graduados se muden de regreso a casa y se preocupan por el éxito final de sus hijos. Lo mejor que los padres pueden hacer es ser solidarios, ser positivos y ser pacientes.

Si eres padre, reconoce que las dificultades para encontrar un trabajo serán normativas este año, no un problema exclusivo de tus hijos. Escucha primero sus frustraciones, sin tratar de resolver sus problemas. Ofrece sugerencias concretas, preséntalas a personas útiles que conozcas, corrige cuando se solicite y sé alentador.

(CNN) — Se iba a llegar a esto.

Desde el momento en que surgió el coronavirus en este país, estaba claro que podía cobrar una cifra brutal de enfermedad y muerte y que, en ausencia de una vacuna o tratamientos, manejarlo requeriría que los estadounidenses hicieran sacrificios desgarradores a gran escala.

Reunir al país para hacer lo que se necesitaba en respuesta requeriría que nuestros líderes nos digan verdades duras y exijan pasos dolorosos, acciones que son tan naturales para los políticos como lo son los pantalones para una jirafa.

Cuando llegó el terrible impacto económico, y los líderes tuvieron que elegir entre esas verdades duras y la complacencia, sabías que los débiles cortarían y huirían.

Después de seis semanas de costosas negacioneCoronavirus, el presidente Donald Trump respaldó los pasos necesarios para frenar la propagación del covid-19.

Hasta que no lo hizo.

Las cosas se pusieron difíciles, como previsiblemente lo harían. Y el presidente se ha alejado de sus científicos y expertos en salud y ha corrido, incluso suprimiendo los consejos de los Centros para el Control y Prevención de Enfermedades de EE.UU. sobre cómo reabrir comunidades de manera segura, poniendo a los gobernadores y alcaldes la responsabilidad de lidiar con la pandemia más mortal en un siglo.

Más preocupado por sobrevivir a las elecciones del otoño boreal que por la supervivencia de sus ciudadanos, el presidente acudió al resentimiento y espera llevar ese viejo fastidio a la victoria en noviembre, como lo ha hecho antes.

Sí, Trump tiene razón cuando dice que el costo económico de trabajar para controlar el virus ya ha sido catastrófico. Decenas de millones de estadounidenses han perdido sus trabajos o negocios casi de la noche a la mañana. La gente está desesperada por volver a sus tareas y la normalidad.

Pero la idea que está fomentando esta carrera para reabrir se basa en su política, no en la solicitud por el sufrimiento y ciertamente no en la ciencia. Los expertos en salud, incluso los suyos, no podrían ser más claros: abra el país de manera prematura y descuidada, y corremos el riesgo de volver a estar donde estábamos en marzo, con infecciones y muertes en aumento que amenazan con abrumar nuestro sistema de atención médica.

Si vamos hacia allí, la economía tendrá que volver a cerrarse o simplemente colapsará.

El presidente ha hecho un cálculo político frío y duro y decidió tomar el camino de la conveniencia egoísta. Él estará del lado de la apertura a toda costa. Juega su carta favorita de estado rojo versus estado azul. Culpa a los médicos por ser demasiado cautelosos y a los demócratas por valorar la ciencia por sobre los trabajos estadounidenses. Obliga a los gobernadores a tomar decisiones difíciles y agonizantes y hacerlos caminar por el tablón. Usa a China como un escudo contra su propia falta inexcusable de no actuar antes.

En lugar de unificar el país, Trump espera abrirse y profundizar las divisiones que han sido tan centrales en su proyecto político. Ya puede ver el efecto polarizador: en las encuestas, en las redes sociales y en Fox News. Si bien la mayoría de los estadounidenses aún prefieren un enfoque cauteloso, las grietas familiares comienzan a formarse.

Un líder responsable se habría comportado de manera diferente; habría seguido a la ciencia y le habría dicho al país que dejar la desagradable receta a mitad de curso solo prolongaría la miseria.

En 1942, cuando los aliados obtuvieron una victoria decisiva y reñida sobre los nazis en el norte de África, Winston Churchill atemperó las buenas noticias de bienvenida con esta advertencia:

“Ahora este no es el final. Ni siquiera es el comienzo de la guerra final. Pero es, quizás, el final del principio”.

Ahí es donde estamos en la batalla contra el covid-19. Eso es lo que un líder honesto y valiente nos diría ahora, como lo han hecho muchos de nuestros gobernadores y alcaldes.

Pero si estabas esperando un momento de liderazgo de este presidente, acertado y churchilliano, no has estado prestando atención. Trump es Trump, primero, último y siempre.

Él es lo que es, lo cual es triste para nuestro país gravemente herido en este momento de juicio atroz."

(CNN Español) — ¿Tenemos el derecho a hacer cualquier cosa en una sociedad?

Esta pregunta cobra mayor relevancia en momentos excepcionales y, sin lugar a dudas, una pandemia lo es. En varios países se han levantado voces contra las órdenes gubernamentales de mantener el distanciamiento físico con el argumento de que un gobierno no puede “coartar” las libertades individuales.

Desde que los seres humanos se agruparon existen reglas y normas que fueron cambiando de región en región y con el paso del tiempo. Pero ninguna sociedad contempla la posibilidad de una “libertad” individual sin límites.

Esto, que parecería una obviedad, está siendo desafiado por diversos grupos frente a la pandemia, principalmente en Estados Unidos. Allí, este discurso se apoya en el argumento legal de la primera y la segunda enmienda a la Constitución que garantizan la libertad de expresión y el derecho a portar de armas respectivamente.

Con la bandera de la “libertad” y contra lo que denominan el poder de un gobierno o del Estado omnipresente, muchas personas deciden desafiar los poderes constituidos.

Llevado al extremo se podría decir que, quienes se oponen a los dictados de los gobiernos sobre la conducta a tener frente a la pandemia, quieren tener el derecho a contagiar y ser contagiados sin que el Estado pueda impedirlo.

Esto, que puede sonar disparatado, tiene un correlato real y práctico con los grupos denominados “antivacunas” -que se oponen a las vacunaciones obligatorias para evitar contagios masivos- y que salieron a las calles exigiendo la libertad de movimientos sin restricciones. En Argentina, diversos referentes del llamado pensamiento conservador o “libertario” incluso convocaron a violar las órdenes del distanciamiento social emitidas por el gobierno con el argumento de que hay que “reactivar la economía”.

Estas visiones están sustentadas en que los seres humanos estarían destinados a una lucha permanente entre ellos, naturalizando el lema “sálvese quien pueda”. En realidad, lo que la pandemia refleja es que la verdadera lucha que aflora es la que existe entre egoísmo y solidaridad."

(CNN) — El fin de semana pasado estaba en CNN discutiendo la importancia de apoyar la salud mental y emocional de los profesionales médicos. Comparé esta pandemia con una bomba invisible que estalló en nuestros departamentos de emergencia.

Veinticuatro horas después supe de la muerte de mi colega, la doctora Lorna Breen. Un día después supe por los informes de los medios que ella se había suicidado. Fue un golpe doble, como si hubiera muerto dos veces.

Lorna había sobrevivido al covid-19 a principios de este mes. A medida que sus síntomas físicos mejoraron, el costo mental de la pandemia continuó empeorando. Y así pasé el martes, mi cumpleaños, llorando la pérdida devastadora más reciente de una colega, una amiga. Y mientras lloraba, reflexioné.

El mundo aclama a los profesionales médicos como héroes, y no me malinterpreten: el elogio público ha sido un cambio bienvenido. Nuestros trabajos eran desgarradores mucho antes de esta crisis y lo seguirán siendo mucho después de que volvamos a la normalidad. Estoy agradecida por el reconocimiento.

Pero la muerte prematura de Lorna es una prueba dolorosa de la batalla oculta que tantos médicos, enfermeras y trabajadores de primera línea están librando en este momento. Una batalla que las palabras de elogio, aunque sean bienvenidas, simplemente no pueden vencer.

La veo desplegarse frente a mí todos los días en el departamento de emergencias aquí en la ciudad de Nueva York. No es la primera vez que trabajo en circunstancias difíciles. Vi muchas tragedias trabajando como médica voluntaria en Iraq durante mis cuatro semanas en el frente de batalla con soldados iraquíes respaldados por Estados Unidos. Pero nunca imaginé un futuro en el que me preocuparía por tantos colegas incapaces de respirar, presumiblemente debido a la infección por coronavirus.

Tratamos a todos como si tuvieran el coronavirus, eso es lo que requiere la mitigación de riesgos. Traté al padre de un amigo en estado crítico y, encima de estar en una situación ya aterradora, debí comenzar las difíciles conversaciones de los cuidados sobre el final de la vida. Sobrevivió, pero las discusiones sobre si intervenir y hasta qué punto bajo tal presión dejan cicatrices.

No concebí aconsejar a una enfermera que conozco en mi departamento de trabajo ante su desesperación e impotencia después de infectar a su madre con el virus. Su madre también sobrevivió y dejó el hospital después de varios días de oxigenoterapia, pero el trauma de su culpa perdurará y tomará mucho, mucho más tiempo para sanar.

Nunca pensé que me infectaría yo misma. Para empeorar las cosas, no tuve acceso a las pruebas cuando me enfermé. Por fortuna, mis síntomas eran tales que podía convalecer en casa (escalofríos, dolores corporales que se convirtieron en un dolor de cabeza implacable y luego agotamiento) y volver al trabajo una semana después. Sin dificultad para respirar, sin respirador. Suerte.

No podía imaginar que vería a un número tan alarmante de adultos mayores y pacientes de hogares de ancianos morir a un ritmo que ninguno de nosotros había experimentado. Nunca pensé que a las familias de los pacientes se les prohibiría visitar a sus seres queridos moribundos; que les daría actualizaciones por teléfono y ofrecería videollamadas de último momento para despedirse. ¿Cómo se prepara uno para facilitar un adiós a través de FaceTime?

Estamos enfrentando la muerte a un ritmo tan acelerado que la expresión “sin precedentes” no es adecuada, no es suficiente. Esta situación no se parece a nada para lo que ninguno de nosotros haya podido prepararse.

Para hacer el trauma aún más profundo, a muchos trabajadores de la salud se les prometió equipo de protección personal que nunca llegó. El departamento de emergencias en el que trabajo ha estado muy bien abastecido, pero otros hospitales en la ciudad de Nueva York continúan experimentando escasez. Nos ponemos en riesgo a nosotros y a nuestros seres queridos cada vez que vamos a trabajar y dependemos de los elementos de protección personal para mantenernos a salvo, para reducir el riesgo de nuestras familias.

Alcanzamos límites físicos y mentales más allá de la imaginación. Al día siguiente, superamos esos límites. Y necesitamos ayuda.

En Iraq brindamos atención bajo niveles inmensos de estrés, a menudo con acceso limitado a recursos. Antes de nuestro despliegue, recibimos capacitación sobre qué esperar y cómo manejar la tensión mental y emocional de la atención médica en una zona de guerra.

Los médicos de las zonas de guerra regresan a casa con probabilidad de desarrollar trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) y dolencias físicas relacionadas. Los riesgos a largo plazo son reales y están bien documentados. Tienen un riesgo mucho mayor de autolesiones y son más propensos al abuso de sustancias y la depresión.

Ahora, en medio de la pandemia de covid-19, los profesionales de la salud en todo el mundo enfrentan niveles extraordinarios de presión que no son tan diferentes a los de una zona de guerra. El trauma de esta crisis está creando una nueva generación de veteranos de guerra en casa, cada uno de los cuales está sirviendo a nuestro país y necesita nuestro apoyo. Pero con las capacidades actuales de nuestras instituciones y la estigmatización cultural de los problemas de salud mental y emocional nosotros, como país, no estamos preparados para apoyarlos.

La triste verdad es que Estados Unidos nunca ha brindado tratamiento adecuado para la salud mental y emocional, como el TEPT, a los valientes ciudadanos que anteponen al país a sus intereses personales. A medida que comenzamos a imaginar un Estados Unidos posterior al covid-19, debemos actuar mejor frente a todos nuestros veteranos, incluidos los cientos de miles de trabajadores de la salud que han sufrido el trauma de esta pandemia. Eso comienza desestigmatizando los problemas de salud mental y facilitando que los médicos, las enfermeras y otras personas busquen la ayuda que necesitan.

Al llorar la pérdida de Lorna y de tantos pacientes, reconozco cuán afortunada soy de haber sido entrenada para ejercer la medicina en contextos de conflicto, de haber recibido una guía que tantos otros no recibieron. Mantengo la cabeza baja, pero mis ojos están bien abiertos. Los profesionales médicos somos en verdad héroes, pero también somos humanos. Muchos de nosotros estamos sufriendo mucho más de lo que podemos expresar y la carga de este momento sobre nuestros hombros es demasiado pesada.

Preste atención a nuestro llamado. La primera línea de batalla de esta pandemia necesita recursos de salud mental y apoyo emocional para procesar la destrucción que no podemos evitar, que no podemos solucionar. La próxima ola se acerca. Necesitamos ayuda antes de que sea demasiado tarde para más de nosotros."
http://cnn.com,[OPINIÓN] Coronavirus: por qué necesitas usar la maldita mascarilla,"Nota del editor: Catherine Pearlman es una trabajadora social clínica, profesora asociada en la Universidad de Brandman y autora de Ignore It!: How Selectively Looking the Other Way Can Decrease Behavioral Problems and Increase Parenting Satisfaction.

(CNN) — Salga a caminar, visite cualquier establecimiento abierto o espacio público y notará un fenómeno desconcertante: personas sin mascarillas.

Hay una pandemia. Decenas de miles de estadounidenses están muertos por causa de covid-19, una enfermedad que se propaga en gotas que son expulsadas por humanos infectados, incluso cuando hablan o tosen, y muestren síntomas o no.

Los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EE.UU. (CDC, por sus siglas en inglés) recomiendan que todos usen un paño que cubra la cara en público, especialmente cuando hay un alto grado de transmisión comunitaria (es decir, cuando se desconoce la fuente de infección). Vivo en California, donde casi 60.000 personas han sido infectadas. En todo el país 1,2 millones de estadounidenses han dado positivo por covid-19, han fallecido más de 73.000 personas y las proyecciones para el futuro (¿otro máximo de infecciones en el otoño boreal?) son realmente sombrías.

Mientras tanto, los hospitales y sus trabajadores se ven obligados a cuidar a los enfermos, y el personal médico trabaja semanas sin días libres para tratar a los afectados, arriesgando sus propias vidas y las de su familia. Y, sin embargo, muchas personas se niegan a tomar en serio las advertencias para protegerse a sí mismos y a los demás al usar una mascarilla en público.

Es difícil determinar cuántos de nosotros somos despistados y descuidados, ¿tal vez la mitad de los que salen? ¿Un tercio? ¿Alguna otra fracción? En todo caso es un número demasiado grande.

La falta de empatía es irritante. Necesitamos un cambio.

Necesitamos que nuestros líderes, todos ellos, den el mensaje alto y claro. Si está lejos del sistema cerrado de su hogar, el mensaje debería ser que use una mascarilla. Eso también significa que los empleadores exijan que los trabajadores de todo tipo se enmascaren. ¿Quieren que la propagación de la enfermedad disminuya? ¿Quieren que los negocios y la economía finalmente se recuperen o no?

Las mascarillas de cualquier tipo no son barreras perfectas para el contagio. Usar una no ofrece protección total y no debe considerarse como una forma segura e infalible de interactuar. Pero los expertos informan que usarla ayuda a protegerse de la transmisión de portadores asintomáticos. Y tenga en cuenta que los datos muestran, según Robert Redfield, director de los CDC designado por el presidente Donald Trump, que probablemente una de cada cuatro personas infectadas con covid-19 es asintomática y desconoce su infección.

Sea prudente, sea amable. Uno puede pensar que la respuesta del gobierno al virus es una reacción exagerada y aun así usar una mascarilla, solo por si acaso pudiera contagiar a alguien. Esa es la realidad.

Usar una mascarilla es engorroso. Da calor y es incómodo. Pero puede salvar vidas y aliviar la carga de aquellos médicos y enfermeras que enfrentan un dolor y sufrimiento indescriptibles en la primera línea de batalla.

Hacer sacrificios personales por el bien público no siempre ha sido una prioridad estadounidense. Somos una cultura individualista, y por naturaleza podemos encontrar más difícil empatizar con los demás cuando sentimos que están en juego nuestra propia libertad y nuestros derechos. Existe una resistencia a permitir que el gobierno o cualquier otra persona intervenga y exija, o incluso urja fuertemente, a los estadounidenses a que se cubran el rostro.

Pero seguramente todos podemos entender que a veces existen regulaciones para proteger a las personas de sí mismas o para evitar el sufrimiento de la comunidad. Exigimos a los conductores que usen cinturones de seguridad para proteger a los pasajeros y minimizar la posibilidad de lesiones graves (esas lesiones no solo afectan al conductor, sino también a los trabajadores de la sala de emergencias e incluso a los contribuyentes que financian subsidios por discapacidad y desempleo).

Las leyes requieren que se vacune a los niños, no solo por el bien del niño sino para mantener la inmunidad a nivel colectivo. No tenemos una vacuna contra el covid-19. Pero todos podemos ayudar hasta que la tengamos: sabemos acerca de las mascarillas.

A principios de la década de 1990, era pasante de trabajo social en la unidad de VIH/sida en el hospital Columbia Presbyterian en la ciudad de Nueva York. El sida seguía siendo una sentencia de muerte, y cada trabajador y visitante tomaba “precauciones universales” para evitar la transmisión del virus. La sabiduría predominante en ese momento y ahora indica que cuando es imposible evaluar si alguien puede estar infectado, hay que usar guantes y mascarillas. Nos protegíamos a nosotros mismos. Sí, usar guantes era incómodo. También lo era contraer el VIH.

¿Dónde están nuestras precauciones universales para el covid-19?

Usar una mascarilla en público es un acto de respeto por los demás humanos. Este es el tipo de empatía que trato de enseñarles a mis hijos. Nuestros niños observan a los adultos durante esta pandemia y aprenden muchas lecciones, intencionadas y no intencionadas.

Quiero que mis hijos comprendan que estar levemente incómodos para lograr un bien mayor no solo es correcto, es un imperativo moral. Es como nos las arreglamos para vivir juntos en relativa seguridad en nuestra sociedad.

Es obvio. Usa la maldita mascarilla."

Nota del editor: Wesley K.

Las opiniones expresadas en este comentario son suyas. Ver más opinión en CNNE.com/opinión.

(CNN) — Estimado Sr. presidente:

Este miércoles (mayo 6), su administración habló de reducir el grupo de trabajo sobre coronavirus y ahora usted dice que continuará indefinidamente. ¿Estará en las reuniones y sesiones informativas? ¿O hablará por separado y socavará o contradirá a sus expertos?

Muchos de mis colegas militares han tratado de ayudar, y todos entienden que usted no acepta críticas, e incluso las sugerencias son mal recibidas. Pero Estados Unidos necesita un liderazgo real ahora, y otros en todo el mundo también nos están mirando. Entonces, como alguien que ha pasado la mayor parte de su vida liderando, estudiando o enseñando liderazgo, ¿puedo ofrecer respetuosamente algunas observaciones que puedan ser útiles? ¿Y puedo hablar con franqueza? Esta podría ser su última oportunidad para hacer bien las cosas.

Primer punto, los líderes tienen que inspirar confianza. No viene automáticamente con la oficina. Tiene que conseguirla por su rendimiento. El público debe ver y creer que sus deberes públicos son lo primero, antes que cualquier otro interés: negocios, amigos o incluso familiares. ¡Y en el caso de esta emergencia médica, antes que su reelección, también! Cuando uno está pendiente de las encuestas y las manifestaciones, está socavando la confianza y la fe del público en su liderazgo.

Otra cosa sobre la confianza: tenga cuidado con lo que dice. Cualquier declaración que luego se demuestre falsa, dañará su reputación. No deje escapar observaciones y posibilidades, sabemos que solo estaba pensando en voz alta sobre el blanqueador y los desinfectantes, pero cada declaración que haga será juzgada. Esa es la carga del liderazgo. Uno no puede estar cambiando lo que dice, y, sinceramente, usted sería el primero en señalar eso en un oponente. No se puede liderar sin la confianza de la gente.

Segundo, los líderes deben tener una estrategia y un plan para posicionarse. Tiene toda la razón al reconocer que, en última instancia, tenemos que poder reabrir la economía. Y nos dio una estrategia bastante buena para reabrir el país mientras esperamos la vacuna, pero parece que está socavando su propia estrategia al alentar a los manifestantes a que presionen por una apertura más temprana. ¿Por qué sabotear su propia estrategia? A menos que esté haciéndolo para tener buenos “números” para su reelección. Por supuesto, esto se remonta al tema de la confianza.

Sr. presidente, si trata con éxito la crisis del covid-19, probablemente obtenga la reelección. En cambio, si empuja prematuramente la apertura de la economía, y Estados Unidos se tambalea hacia picos repetitivos del virus, es probable que no sea reelegido. Entonces, primero lo primero.

Tercero, los líderes aceptan sus responsabilidades. Usted es el funcionario electo con el cargo más alto del país: toda la rama ejecutiva trabaja para usted, y cualquier cosa que hagan o digan es, en última instancia, su responsabilidad. Nadie espera que sea perfecto, pero como señala el famoso letrero en el escritorio de Harry Truman: “la responsabilidad es suya”. Admita algunos errores o reconozca que sus proyecciones u opiniones han cambiado y explique por qué. Si esquiva las responsabilidades ahora, no podrá reclamar crédito cuando ganemos esta lucha. Y, por cierto, deje de culpar a sus predecesores, eso lo hace lucir de poca monta y seguro que no quiere eso.

Cuarto, no se espera que los líderes de alto nivel lo sepan todo, pero se espera que traigan a los expertos adecuados y aprovechen sus conocimientos. Sus expertos constantemente esquivan y reelaboran sus declaraciones públicas. Es obvio que los tiene al borde de la intimidación y el miedo. Tiene todo el poder, no necesita liderar de esa manera. Cuando le brinden información inexacta o proyecciones refutadas, reemplácelas y haga que rindan cuentas. Pero de lo contrario, póngalas al frente para discutir los tecnicismos, y no choque, corrija o se ponga por delante de ellos en público.

Quinto, en tiempos problemáticos, los líderes muestran empatía. Las pérdidas estadounidenses ya son chocantes en términos personales, y muchas de estas pérdidas se encuentran entre sus partidarios entre la clase trabajadora. Estas personas tienen familias, seres queridos, amigos y colegas que esperan su empatía, y si tienen la sensación de que estas pérdidas no son más que un “número que se interpone en el camino de su reelección”, lo responsabilizarán personalmente. Muestre empatía todos los días, visite a las familias, hable con los médicos y las enfermeras en la primera línea, consuelo, consuelo, consuelo, eso es lo que exige el liderazgo.

Sexto, los buenos líderes reúnen a sus equipos. Hasta cierto punto, ha creado un nuevo modelo político para un EE.UU. moderno, basado en la sobrealimentación de su base, a expensas de otros en el electorado, así como en la entrega de los “bienes” en términos de jueces, desregulación y recortes de impuestos. Funcionó lo suficientemente bien como para que lo eligieran y para que el dinero entrara en su campaña electoral. Pero en esta crisis, como decimos de donde vengo: “ese perro no cazará”, o sea, que esa excusa no servirá. Ahora tiene que liderar un país, no ganar una elección, y lo sabe. Estados Unidos, cada uno de nosotros, es su “equipo”, ya sea para mantener la distancia social, impulsar soluciones innovadoras o ayudar a trabajar la logística del envasado de carne o suministrar mascarillas, sin importar si son demócratas o republicanos.

Por favor, no busque más enemigos, porque lo único que hace es perjudicarnos a todos. Si bien el gobierno federal confía correctamente en los estados para una evaluación y respuesta a las condiciones locales, esta es su oportunidad de ir más allá del partidismo y unir al país. Detenga la insulsa competencia con esos gobernadores demócratas, lo debilita totalmente a usted y a su administración. Podría ser mucho más efectivo si los incorporara a su equipo y construyesen respeto mutuo.

Séptimo, los buenos líderes cumplen su función dando el ejemplo. Entonces, si quiere que las personas usen mascarillas, use una. La visita de Honeywell el martes fue buena, pero le restó mérito al no usar públicamente un tapabocas. Y, por supuesto, la prensa sacó provecho, porque creen que es uno de esos líderes de “haz lo que digo, no lo que hago”, y eso nos lleva al tema de la confianza nuevamente.

Octavo, los buenos líderes conservan la entereza, al menos en público. No permiten que se vean sus miedos, resentimientos o enojo: se trata del control. En privado, seguro, se enojan, curan las heridas sobre su orgullo e intentan aprender de cada evento y comentario para seguir adelante. Como solíamos decir en el Ejército, “no lleves el corazón en la manga”, donde se lastima y golpea constantemente. Así que, por favor, deje de responder a cada comentario ofensivo, eso puede funcionar para obtener seguidores en Twitter, como entretenimiento, pero no es una forma efectiva de liderar.

Entonces, Sr. presidente, sé que este consejo suena duro y doloroso, pero usted es un estratega astuto, un hecho que sus oponentes a menudo no entienden. También es un negociador capaz, como lo demostró recientemente al hacer un trato por el recorte de 10 millones de barriles por día en la producción de petróleo. Y es fuerte y resiliente. Esas son todas buenas cualidades. Pero no puede ser un líder efectivo sin un autoexamen implacable y doloroso. Tómelo o déjelo, después de la debida consideración.

Mi objetivo al escribir esto es ayudarlo, porque hoy, Estados Unidos y, de hecho, todo el mundo, necesita liderazgo, y aunque a algunos no les guste, usted es el hombre. ¡TODOS lo necesitamos en su mejor versión posible!

Sinceramente,

Wesley Clark"

(CNN Español) — Un tema recurrente en estos tiempos es la interrogante sobre si Estados Unidos seguirá siendo “el imperio” o la “primera potencia del mundo. No es una discusión nueva, sobre todo porque en la era Trump se han tomado decisiones que alejan a pasos agigantados el posicionamiento de ese país como el de mayor importancia de la Tierra.

Actualmente Estados Unidos es la economía más grande del mundo y tiene un poderío militar imponente. Sin embargo, los parámetros de medición para ser “la potencia” no solo deben circunscribirse a esos aspectos, hay que valorar también los avances tecnológicos en comparación con el resto del mundo, la influencia global, la satisfacción de sus nacionales, el PIB y sobre todo, su capacidad de liderazgo.

Lo que se percibe como la pérdida de liderazgo y de poder político internacional, las malas decisiones en el campo diplomático y la nueva manera de gobernar por Twitter denotan síntomas de debilidad de EE.UU.

Hay una serie de circunstancias que desnudan al sistema estadounidense de hoy: el ataque a la OMS, el abandono del acuerdo de París sobre cambio climático, la salida del acuerdo suscrito por distintos países para frenar el programa nuclear de Irán, las amenazas a China y México -por ejemplo- o el pretendido pero fracasado intento de generar un cambio en Venezuela a través de las meras intenciones. Todo ello, unido al “primero USA”, está haciendo mella en el corazón del país más próspero del mundo.

El dólar es definitivamente la moneda más importante del mundo y otro factor para medir la fuerza de un país, pero en este aspecto hay que resaltar -como bien lo comenta Peter S. Goodman-, la enorme deuda pública de EE.UU. y los malos antecedentes de la última crisis financiera. Pero, por otro lado, China no ha podido promover su moneda a pesar de los incentivos, y el euro tiene grandes limitaciones. Todo esto juega en favor del dólar.

La primera potencia del mundo no debería tener que pedir ayuda, como ocurrió con el coronavirus. Los verdaderos imperios son previsivos y tienen que tener la capacidad de ayudar.

Mientras tanto, China, con mucha rapidez, juega muy duro en todos los aspectos y de no haber un cambio de rumbo en EE.UU., pronto se posicionará como la primera potencia, dejando de lado también a Rusia, que sin tanto dinero, pero con la fuerza del liderazgo político muy bien ejercido por Putin, se mantiene en la pelea.

Sabiendo lo que se avecina la pregunta es si será Trump el Nerón del siglo XXI. La historia lo dirá."

(CNN Español) — El New York Times publicó un artículo justo para el Domingo de Pascua, que reportaba las denuncias de una exempleada del entonces senador y ahora virtual candidato presidencial demócrata, Joe Biden.

Tara Reade, quien trabajó por casi un año en la oficina del senador Biden, alega que este la agredió sexualmente. Muchos medios destacaron que Reade ya había salido con la noticia el año pasado diciendo que Biden había le había tocado los hombros y el cuello, haciéndola sentir incómoda.

No fue sino hasta la semana pasada cuando el exvicepresidente habló del tema en una entrevista y fue contundente al afirmar: “Eso nunca ocurrió”.

La disyuntiva real que ha causado esta acusación es el peso que recae sobre el movimiento Me Too. Cuando salieron los señalamientos de la Dra. Blassey Ford contra el entonces candidato a juez de la Corte Suprema de EE.UU., Brett Kavanaugh, la cobertura en medios y el ataque del movimiento Me Too al magistrado fueron abrumadores. Las duras críticas hacia el movimiento Me Too y hacia reconocidas feministas y organismos defensores de las causas a favor de las mujeres no cesan.

Y es que, sin importar la afiliación política, el objetivo principal de muchos de estos movimientos es que las víctimas hablen y no vivan en silencio, y más aun tratándose de figuras públicas y poderosas. Se quiere dar el ejemplo en todos los sectores de la sociedad de que cuando una víctima de agresión haga pública una denuncia contra su agresor será escuchada.

Se han presentado casos similares de prominentes personajes del entretenimiento con diferentes matices, que han sido muestras de que el valor de una víctima al relatar su angustia y experiencia, sumado a varios frentes de organismos que respalden la causa y a un sistema de justicia equitativo, proveen la esperanza de que sí se pueden romper antiguos paradigmas y estigmas sociales.

Lamentablemente había sido muy poca la cobertura en los medios, hasta hace poco, de esta denuncia de Tara Reade y el hecho de que al virtual candidato a la presidencia por el Partido Demócrata no se le había preguntado si tenía alguna reacción a esta denuncia ha dejado a este movimiento Me Too y a sus líderes al descubierto. Cabe destacar, sin embargo, que en una columna reciente, el reportero de CNN, Chris Cillizza, resalta la oportunidad que perdió Biden en uno de sus más recientes conversatorios virtuales, donde contó con la presencia de Hillary Clinton, de haber podido dar su respuesta a los alegatos de Tara Reade.

Cillizza señala además que el clamor para que Biden contestara de frente estas preguntas no disminuía, sino por el contrario solo aumentó y más aún, cuando él mismo ha establecido que el 3 de noviembre los votantes deben seleccionar un candidato con moral. En un reciente desarrollo reportado por la corresponsal de CNN, MJ Lee, el relato de Lynda LaCasse, una vecina de Tara Reade, ofrece detalles adicionales que parecen corroboran la denuncia de Reade. LaCasse ofrece detalles de lo que Reade compartió con ella en la época de la supuesta agresión sexual.

Lo que resulta inconcebible es que a los pocos a los cuales que se le preguntó en el momento si tenían alguna reacción hayan sido tan “políticamente correctos”, sean su excontrincante, el senador Bernie Sanders que afirmó “Es relevante hablar de todo, si una mujer siente que ha sido agredida tiene todo el derecho en el mundo de levantarse y hacer su reclamo”, mientras que la senadora Amy Klobuchar dijo; “Todas la mujeres en estos casos tienen el derecho a ser escuchadas y que se revisen detenidamente sus casos” o la representante Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Esta última expresó que toda mujer merece contar su historia y que es válido indagar sobre los méritos de la acusación. En una entrevista, Ocasio afirmó “si queremos mantener integridad, no podemos decir: creamos en toda mujer, siempre y cuando no sea inconveniente”.

En 2016 varias mujeres hicieron acusaciones similares contra el entonces candidato presidencial republicano Donald Trump. Varias de ellas, contando con lujo de detalles los avances indeseados y de carácter sexual que, aseguraban, le habían hecho el ahora presidente de Estados Unidos. En ese momento y -aún recientemente- continúan los reportajes de esos sucesos que, por tratarse de Donald Trump, los medios de comunicación cubren con lujo de detalles.

La realidad es que la doble vara al cubrir a dos figuras públicas que se medirán con toda probabilidad en las próximas elecciones puede ser eje de controversia y de muchas columnas, pero me quiero concentrar en lo decepcionante que es para los electores el tener solo a estas dos figuras públicas como opción en noviembre para presidente de la nación. Tengamos en cuenta que, aún con las innumerables acusaciones y el audio en el que se escuchó a Donald Trump expresándose despectivamente de las mujeres, fue elegido presidente número 45 de este país.

Por otro lado, ahora tenemos a un exvicepresidente que no solo se enfrenta a señalamientos similares, sino a los posibles conflictos de interés por los negocios de su hijo Hunter Biden en Ucrania y en China cuando Joe Biden era vicepresidente.

Lo que queda claro es que las bases políticas sacan las garras por candidatos plagados de defectos solo por preservar el poder, y escoger el que ante sus ideologías es el menos malo.

Luego de haber tenido seis mujeres aspirando a la candidatura del Partido Demócrata y en momentos cuando las mujeres han sido líderes de altura mundial en medio de esta pandemia que nos azota, nos tendremos que conformar -si acaso- con una potencial candidata vicepresidencial por el Partido Demócrata. Será interesante saber qué postura tendrá esa posible candidata ante las denuncias contra su compañero de papeleta y ante la inequidad que aún vivimos las mujeres en Estados Unidos."

(CNN) — Adiós a los desayunos en bufé y el servicio de botones. Bienvenidos la detección de temperatura y el registro sin llave.

Si bien las políticas de la era de la pandemia aún se están desarrollando en hoteles de todo el mundo y sin duda variarán ampliamente, es seguro decir que los huéspedes verán grandes cambios la próxima vez que se registren en cualquier lugar.

En el futuro previsible, hasta que esté disponible una vacuna, un tratamiento ampliamente efectivo o pruebas instantáneas para el coronavirus, es probable que las estadías en hoteles sean un asunto austero, particularmente en hoteles de alta gama donde el servicio personalizado y las comodidades han sido parte durante mucho tiempo parte del encanto, dice Christopher Anderson, profesor de negocios en la Escuela de Hoteles de la Universidad de Cornell en Ithaca, Nueva York.

Habrá menos acceso comunitario en los hoteles, “por lo que no habrá bufés, ni minibares”, y muchos de los “elementos de lujo de alto contacto”, como los tratamientos de spa y el servicio de botones y valet, pueden ser suspendidos, predice Anderson.

Los invitados querrán check-in y checkout sin llave y sin contacto y pocas interacciones personalizadas.

“Vamos a querer eliminarlos y básicamente entrar en el hotel, subir por el ascensor por sí mismos, entrar a la habitación sin tener que tocar nada con la comodidad de que el proveedor de servicios haya desinfectado completamente ese espacio antes de mi llegada”, dice el experto.

En Estados Unidos, hay atisbos débiles de un retorno en la demanda de habitaciones de hotel, según Jan Freitag, vicepresidente senior de Lodging Insights para la firma de análisis de servicios STR.

La ocupación hotelera para la semana que finalizó el 2 de mayo fue del 28,6% en Estados Unidos, lo que le dio a STR su primera “evidencia sólida” de un retorno de la demanda de ocio, liderado por estados que habían aliviado las restricciones.

La ocupación aún disminuyó 58% en comparación con la misma semana del año pasado.

A medida que aumenta la demanda, la industria hotelera está tratando de asegurar a los huéspedes potenciales que han implementado medidas adicionales para protegerlos contra la transmisión del coronavirus a medida que los estados y países comienzan a reabrir sus economías.

Socialmente distante y más limpio que nunca

La higiene, por supuesto, es una de las principales preocupaciones, y la Asociación Estadounidense de Hoteles y Alojamiento publicó el lunes los estándares de seguridad (Stay Safe) en toda la industria. Muchos grupos hoteleros importantes también han esbozado nuevas políticas.

El gigante de los hoteles Hilton está desarrollando políticas con la ayuda del equipo de Prevención y Control de Infecciones de la Clínica de Mayo. Hilton está explorando el uso de pulverizadores electrostáticos, que rocían uniformemente desinfectante en áreas amplias, y luz ultravioleta para desinfectar superficies y objetos.

Marriott ya ha anunciado que utilizará pulverizadores electrostáticos para limpiar las habitaciones y áreas públicas y está probando la tecnología de luz ultravioleta. Marriott y otras marcas también retirarán muebles y reconfigurarán muchas áreas para facilitar el espacio de distancia social de dos metros prescrito por los funcionarios de salud. La marca está considerando barreras de plexiglás en los escritorios para separar a los huéspedes y al personal del hotel.

Estas nuevas medidas ciertamente afectarán los costos de bolsillo de los propietarios de hoteles, dice Freitag, pero no está claro si los huéspedes verán esos costos en las tarifas de las habitaciones.

“Quizás las tarifas de limpieza son las nuevas tarifas del resort”, dice Freitag. En cualquier caso, alojarse en un hotel en 2020 será “absolutamente” más barato que el año pasado.

Los huéspedes en más de 3.200 hoteles Marriott pueden usar sus teléfonos para registrarse, acceder a sus habitaciones y solicitar un servicio de habitaciones especialmente empaquetado que se entrega en su puerta sin contacto.

Las máscaras y guantes para el personal serán omnipresentes en muchos hoteles, y las toallitas desinfectantes y desinfectantes para manos serán las últimas incorporaciones a los espacios públicos y los kits de artículos de higiene personal.

El Venetian en Las Vegas se encuentra entre muchas propiedades que subrayan la regla de dos metros de distanciamiento social con marcas para indicar el espacio adecuado en los escritorios delanteros, vestíbulos de ascensores, cafeterías, lugares de entretenimiento y más.

Los empleados de recepción del Venetian utilizarán cualquier otra estación de trabajo para el distanciamiento adecuado y las máquinas tragamonedas, mesas de restaurante, tumbonas de piscina y más se han separado para cumplir con la regla.

El resort sugiere no más de cuatro huéspedes en un ascensor. El hotel Hamilton en Washington, DC, insta a los huéspedes a limitar ese número a dos.

Las propiedades también describen políticas específicas para casos sospechosos o confirmados de covid-19 en el lugar. Esas medidas a menudo incluyen medidas intensivas de desinfección por terceros de habitaciones ocupadas por huéspedes que se enferman.

¿Se les harán pruebas a los huéspedes?

La detección de temperatura para huéspedes y empleados es una línea de defensa para detectar posibles infecciones, pero no está claro cuán ampliamente se implementará en los hoteles.

En The Venetian en Las Vegas, que aún no se ha reabierto, se usarán escáneres térmicos en cada punto de entrada “permitiendo controles discretos y no invasivos de temperatura” para el personal y los huéspedes, de acuerdo con las nuevas políticas del complejo de Venetian Clean.

En Singapur, una campaña nacional llamada SG Clean se ha implementado en todas las industrias e incluye un conjunto de estándares para hoteles, que incluye controles de temperatura para los huéspedes, “cuando sea factible y aplicable”.

The Four Seasons en Nueva York ha estado siguiendo un conjunto increíblemente austero de protocolos temporales desde que comenzó a recibir trabajadores de la salud a principios de abril.

Esas políticas, desarrolladas por la compañía de gestión de riesgos de viajes International SOS, incluyen un único punto de entrada para todos donde se verifica la temperatura de cada persona y las enfermeras hacen preguntas las 24 horas del día, según el arquitecto del plan, el Dr. Robert Quigley, vicepresidente senior de International SOS y director médico regional para las Américas.

Pero la transmisión asintomática significa que también se requiere un distanciamiento social estricto, y Quigley predice que las mejores prácticas en la detección en los hoteles podrían evolucionar con la disponibilidad de pruebas de diagnóstico rápido.

El plan del Four Seasons fue el primer conjunto de normas de higiene de coronavirus de International SOS para un hotel y se ha adaptado para otros hoteles que albergan trabajadores médicos, pero Quigley dijo en las últimas semanas que las propiedades comenzaron a contactar a la compañía sobre prácticas que podrían usarse para turistas tradicionales y viajeros de negocios.

Pero el nivel de evaluación implementado en el Four Seasons de New York durante este período probablemente no sea factible para todas las propiedades, reconoce Quigley.

“No será realista para los hoteles de todo el espectro tener estas medidas extremas de mitigación de las que estoy hablando”, dijo. “Y entonces tienen que decir, estos hoteles que no tienen esas capacidades o recursos, ‘¿Cuál es nuestro apetito por el riesgo? ¿Cuál es nuestro deber de cuidado con nuestros empleados y con nuestros huéspedes?'”.

¿Qué se necesita para mantener a los huéspedes seguros?

Rudy Tauscher, gerente general del Four Seasons New York, ha estado a la vanguardia de la acogida de trabajadores de la salud de esa cadena. Ha estado reflexionando sobre cómo cambiará la experiencia tradicional de los huéspedes.

“¿Hay un momento diferente, por ejemplo, entre el check-in y el check-out? Muy a menudo los hoteles tienen un cambio en el momento del check out por la mañana y por la tarde, la habitación está ocupada nuevamente. ¿Habrá un período prolongado de tiempo de digamos, 24 horas?”, se preguntó Tauscher, notando que estaba actuando sin pensar sobre las posibles modificaciones.

Las estructuras de costos y los modelos operativos tendrían que ser considerados, dijo.

Desde que Four Seasons New York comenzó a recibir trabajadores médicos en el epicentro del coronavirus, un protocolo de limpieza diseñado por International SOS ha implicado dejar las habitaciones vacías durante largos períodos entre una serie de limpiezas para asegurarse de que se elimine cualquier contaminación.

Pero ese protocolo se adaptó a una situación muy específica. La marca de lujo Four Seasons está trabajando exactamente en las nuevas medidas que los huéspedes encontrarán en sus hoteles de todo el mundo y en la propiedad en la calle 57 de Nueva York cuando vuelva a abrir para los huéspedes que no son trabajadores de la salud.

Las medidas de distanciamiento social, la reducción de la capacidad de los espacios públicos y el rediseño de restaurantes, bares e instalaciones de fitness estarán entre los cambios.

“Una vez que se reanuden los niveles de negocios, reconocemos que las expectativas y necesidades de los huéspedes del hotel habrán cambiado, y Four Seasons está bien posicionado para salir de esta crisis con una nueva perspectiva sobre lo que significa el lujo para este nuevo mundo: adoptar la tecnología, mejorar herramientas y capacitación y fortalecimiento de nuestros ya estrictos protocolos de salud, seguridad y limpieza”, dijo Christian Clerc, presidente de operaciones globales de Four Seasons, en un comunicado.

El futuro de los espacios y servicios de alto contacto

Muchos de los espacios públicos y las comodidades de un hotel necesitarán una revisión para la era del coronavirus.

Por ejemplo, el servicio de habitaciones podría preservarse ya que hay más control sobre quién toca qué, dice Anderson, de Cornell’s Hotel School, pero es probable que los buffets no funcionen.

Y no está seguro de que los servicios como los buffets —bien sea las barras de desayuno o los bufetes al estilo exagerado de Las Vegas— vuelvan.

“Creo que solo nuestra conciencia de la transmisión ahora aumentará y, por lo tanto, aunque sea seguro y no haya un susto de pandemia, psicológicamente podría no ser atractivo”, dijo.

Es probable que las comidas precocidas o listas para llevar sean la solución en el futuro cercano, dijo Anderson.

Las áreas públicas de alto contacto, como los spas y gimnasios, donde también es difícil la distancia social, presentan un “riesgo muy, muy alto de transmisión”, dijo Quigley, con muchas manijas y picaportes que necesitarían una limpieza muy atenta.

Pero no todos los hoteles han renunciado a esos servicios.

Anantara Hotels, Resorts & Spas, con sede en Bangkok, dijo al describir sus nuevas políticas que “las clases de entrenamiento y holísticas se adaptarán para el bienestar óptimo de los huéspedes”, haciendo referencia a sesiones privadas de entrenamiento personal.

Y Mandarin Oriental también espera ofrecer muchos de sus servicios personalizados. Todavía están resolviendo los detalles, pero el director de spa de la marca de lujo no quiere privar aún más a los huéspedes que ansiaban el contacto humano incluso antes de que se produjera la pandemia.

“Si el contacto social se vuelve aún más raro después del coronavirus, los spas pueden proporcionar un refugio único donde las personas pueden experimentar el contacto en un ambiente limpio y seguro”, dijo Jeremy McCarthy, director de spa y bienestar del grupo hotelero.

Requerirá confianza inspiradora del cliente, dijo.

Totalmente.

Los hoteles de todo el mundo harán todo lo posible para tranquilizar a los huéspedes. Queda por ver cuán rápido vuelve esa confianza."
http://cnn.com,Una “burbuja de viajes” entre Australia y Nueva Zelandia podría ser un modelo para el futuro,"Nueva Zelandia: flexibilizan medidas por el covid-19 1:10

(CNN) – Puede pasar algún tiempo antes de que los turistas vuelvan a viajar por el mundo. Pero, ¿qué pasaría si pudieras desplazarte a través de partes designadas y aprobadas?

Los políticos de Australia y Nueva Zelandia están discutiendo la posibilidad de abrir fronteras entre los dos países, creando un corredor o una “burbuja de viajes” en sus territorios.

Las dos naciones cerraron casi por completo sus fronteras a ciudadanos extranjeros en marzo, lo que implicó un gran golpe para sus respectivas industrias turísticas. Pero ahora, que estos países al parecer lograron controlar sus brotes de coronavirus, los políticos están discutiendo cuándo se podrían abrir las fronteras entre ellos.

“Si hay algún país con el que pudiéramos reconectarnos primero, sin duda es Nueva Zelandia”, aseguró el primer ministro de Australia Scott Morrison el mes pasado.

“Esa es una situación en la que a todos nos gustaría estar. Pero, por supuesto, nuestro enfoque número uno en este momento es asegurarnos de que los dos países están en la posición de manejar el covid-19 a nivel nacional hasta el punto en que podamos abrir las fronteras con confianza”, señaló la primera ministra de Nueva Zelandia, Jacinda Ardern, el pasado 27 de abril.

“Una cosa que no estoy dispuesta a hacer es perjudicar la posición en la que se encuentra Nueva Zelandia por apresurarnos a abrir nuestras fronteras, incluso a Australia”.

¿Cómo cambiará el futuro de los viajes aéreos? 3:33

No está claro cuándo esta “burbuja” podría ser una realidad: actualmente los dos países mantienen restricciones de viajes nacionales y todas las llegadas internacionales están sujetas a una cuarentena de 14 días.

Los expertos de la industria de viajes indican que en agosto podría ser la implementación de este corredor, posiblemente a tiempo para la temporada de esquí en Nueva Zelandia y las vacaciones escolares en septiembre.

Una relación especial

Existen algunas razones por las que Nueva Zelandia y Australia serían la primera elección del otro para abrir sus fronteras.

Aunque los dos países están separados por unos 2.000 kilómetros (cerca de 1.243 millas) de mar, mantienen una de las relaciones bilaterales más cercanas del mundo. Las personas con pasaporte australiano pueden viajar y trabajar en Nueva Zelandia indefinidamente sin una visa, y viceversa.

Los dos países también contribuyen en gran medida a la industria turística del otro.

Los australianos representan casi el 40% de las llegadas internacionales a Nueva Zelandia, y alrededor del 24% del gasto de visitantes extranjeros en el país. Eso es especialmente significativo en Nueva Zelandia, donde el turismo es la industria de exportación más grande del país. (El turismo se considera una industria de exportación porque implica el uso de efectivo extranjero para comprar bienes y servicios).

En cuanto a Australia, los neozelandeses representan alrededor del 15% de los visitantes internacionales del país, y alrededor del 6% del gasto de los extranjeros. El turismo representa miles de millones para Australia, pese a que es la cuarta industria de exportación más grande del país.

En las dos naciones, las industrias turísticas han recibido un gran golpe a raíz del brote de coronavirus, así que no es de extrañar que los representantes de la industria estén de acuerdo con la perspectiva de una “burbuja de viajes”.

“El mensaje del lado de la industria es que la burbuja es un proyecto con posibilidades”, dijo Simon Westaway, director ejecutivo del Consejo Australiano de la Industria del Turismo, y agregó que esta era la única forma de llevar turismo internacional a Australia en un futuro cercano.

“Si podemos añadir a los australianos, eso sería enormemente beneficioso para la supervivencia de las empresas de turismo y miles de empleos”, destacó Chris Roberts, presidente ejecutivo de Tourism Industry Aotearoa, que representa a la industria del turismo en Nueva Zelandia. Roberts añadió que la cantidad de dinero que los visitantes gastan en el país se redujo en al menos 2.000 millones de dólares neozelandeses (1.220 millones de dólares) al mes.

Los efectos del coronavirus en el turismo 4:34

Pero Roberts no espera que se alcancen los mismos niveles de turistas australianos en Nueva Zelandia antes del covid-19: él cree que muchos optarían por viajar solo a nivel nacional.

En Australia, algunos operadores turísticos centraron su atención en China, que representa aproximadamente el 15% de los visitantes que llegan Australia y el 27% del gasto turístico total. Westaway sostuvo que esas empresas tendrían que adaptarse y descubrir cómo atraer a más viajeros neozelandeses.

¿Cómo funcionaría?

Algo para tener en cuenta: Australia se compone de estados y territorios, y algunos de ellos actualmente tienen reglas adicionales de cuarentena vigentes. Por ejemplo, una persona que viaja desde Sydney (en Nueva Gales del Sur) a Brisbane (en Queensland) necesitaría someterse a un período de aislamiento de 14 días.

Los aeropuertos también tendrían que implementar nuevos procedimientos.

Roberts imagina un futuro en el que los turistas puedan llegar al aeropuerto, hacerse la prueba de detección de covid-19 y solo se les permita subir al avión si el resultado es negativo. Una vez que llegan a su destino, se les puede medir la temperatura. También es posible que los viajeros necesiten proporcionar más información de lo habitual para poder localizarlos fácilmente, en caso de ser necesario.

Ahora, tanto Roberts como Westaway creen que la burbuja solo funcionaría si se elimina el actual período de cuarentena de 14 días para cualquier persona que ingrese al país.

Una vez que la “burbuja de viajes” se ponga a prueba, Nueva Zelandia podría incluir a otros territorios en la medida, tal vez Taiwán y Hong Kong, dijo Roberts.

“Creo que será país por país”, indicó. “Una apertura general de las fronteras podría estar muy lejos”, aclaró.

¿Podría la “burbuja de viajes” hacerse más grande?

También hay algunas discusiones sobre la ampliación de la burbuja para incluir las islas del Pacífico.

Desde el punto de vista de salud, las naciones de las islas del Pacífico parecen haber escapado del brote de coronavirus en gran medida ilesas. Fiji, la nación de las islas del Pacífico más afectada, ha reportado solo 18 casos de coronavirus y ninguna muerte. Guam, que es un territorio estadounidense y no una nación, ha informado de más de 140 casos de coronavirus y cinco muertes.

Muchas naciones insulares del Pacífico cerraron sus fronteras bastante rápido para protegerse contra la posible propagación.

Pero la pandemia ha afectado el turismo de esta zona, una de las regiones más dependientes de la ayuda en el mundo.

Ardern ha pedido precaución al incluir el Pacífico: “Nuestros vecinos del Pacífico en gran parte no han sido afectados por el covid-19, y lo último que queremos es arriesgar eso”.

Pero ampliar la “burbuja de viajes” entre Australia y Nueva Zelandia –al menos a algunas islas del Pacífico– ayudaría a impulsar la industria turística de las islas, sostuvo Stephen Howes, director del Centro de Políticas de Desarrollo de la Universidad Nacional de Australia, en Canberra.

“Para muchas personas es muy difícil”, dijo acerca del efecto sobre el turismo en el Pacífico. “Algunos han regresado a su pueblo… la gente simplemente está luchando por sobrevivir”, mencionó.

“Obviamente, ningún país se vería obligado a hacer esto”, advirtió, y agregó que el corredor de viaje siempre se puede detener si no funciona. “Sería una tarea compleja… pero ciertamente vale la pena intentarlo”, acotó.

El coronavirus deja ciudades desiertas alrededor del mundo 1:26

Además, incluir a las islas del Pacífico también ayudaría a Australia y Nueva Zelandia, permitiendo que los trabajadores migrantes ingresen a ambos países. La medida podría tener un gran impacto de poder en la región, que es de importancia estratégica para Nueva Zelandia, Australia y China.

“Esta es una prueba real”, sostuvo Howes. “Si Australia y Nueva Zelandia continúan y solo tienen una asociación trans-Tasman, realmente podrían antagonizar con el Pacífico. Sería como ‘bueno, realmente no importa’”.

Roberts coincidió en que la burbuja beneficiaría al Pacífico, y dijo que sin turismo, sus economías están en serios problemas.

“En términos de ayuda económica para nuestros vecinos del Pacífico, eso sería lo mejor que podríamos hacer por ellos, siempre que podamos realizarlo de manera segura”, manifestó.

¿Es este el futuro de los viajes?

Una posible burbuja de viajes entre Australia y Nueva Zelandia podría terminar siendo un modelo para el resto del mundo, según Roberts y Westaway.

Al igual que otros países, Nueva Zelandia y Australia deberán tener cuidado de no apresurarse y causar una segunda ola de covid-19.

Implementar acciones demasiado rápido también podría poner en peligro su imagen ante los turistas internacionales, que consideran a los países como lugares limpios y confiables.

Pero en general, Roberts y Westaway están optimistas.

“Si (el detalle) se puede resolver entre Nueva Zelandia y Australia, también se pueden aplicar a otros lugares”, aseguró Roberts.

“Ahora se presta mucha atención a esta parte del mundo debido al aparente éxito de Nueva Zelandia y Australia en contener el brote del virus. Si también podemos encontrar una forma de reanudar los viajes entre países, estoy seguro el resto del mundo resultará muy interesado en ver cómo funciona eso”, agregó."

(CNN Español) — ¡Pasó el primer lunes de mayo que ha sido la fecha más importante del mundo de la moda y las celebridades por décadas! Es cuando se celebra en el Museo Metropolitano de Nueva York la espectacular gala anual a beneficio del Instituto del Vestido -conocida como The Met Gala o La fiesta del año- y por sus famosas escaleras vemos desfilar alrededor de medio millar de invitados muy especiales, que han pagado US$ 30.000 por el exclusivo boleto, creando la alfombra roja más surrealista del mundo.

Un espectáculo único, que cuesta a sus patrocinadores varios millones de dólares y recauda otros tantos, para mantener The Costume Institute y su programa de becas en el museo; y donde desfilan todos los grandes diseñadores del mundo y las modelos y celebridades más famosas del momento, vestidas con sus creaciones.

Pero este año 2020 la gala ha sido otro de los eventos impactados por el covid-19 y fue pospuesta.

Déjenme contarles…

Como periodista he cubierto esta sensacional fiesta por décadas, y estas “llegadas” de los famosos siempre han sido más que fascinantes. Y de los años en que -con entusiasmo, pero también con discreta elegancia- veíamos llegar al tope de las escaleras (donde estábamos esperando la docena de periodistas que la cubríamos, parados en el vestíbulo del museo) a Jackie Kennedy Onassis (en 1979 fue a su primera gala vestida de Valentino), a Carolina Herrera, a Estée Lauder, a Jacqueline de Ribes y a la princesa Diana (en 1996) como invitadas de honor ¡hasta el circo en que se ha convertido en los últimos años con los invitados más extravagantes, vestidos con diseños increíbles y creando mini-espectáculos mediáticos, al estilo de divertidos ‘tableaux vivants’, mientras cientos de fotógrafos y cámaras de video les dan la bienvenida a gritos.

Sí, a gritos, porque los fotógrafos, parados a ambos lados de las anchas escaleras, se vuelven como locos con estas llegadas que nos confunden, pues los periodistas allí presentes no sabemos ni dónde mirar… ¡y entre las 7:30 P.M. y las 8:00 P.M. especialmente, es una media hora de locura, pues las llegadas con los grandes vestidos se suceden y se crea un problema de tráfico humano, o ‘traffic jam’, que a veces resulta comiquísimo!

”¡Mira, llegó al fin Beyoncé… le gusta ser siempre la última!”, “Lady Gaga, mira para acá, para acá Gaga… Ah, se ha quitado el vestido rosa y tiene un leotardo negro… Gaga… Gaga…” “Ha venido JLo con ARod… Jennifer… Jennifer…” “Sarah Jessica Parker está del brazo de Alexander Mcqueen, vestidos de escoceses…” “Sarah-Jessica aquí, mira para aquí… Sarahhhhh…” “Esos son los Beckham,… Victoria, David… aquí… aquí…” ”Guau, Rihanna está vestida como el papa, con corona y crucifijo…” “Katy Perry es un candelabro viviente…” “Cardi B se ha robado la noche con esa cola gigante… Cardi, Cardi, mira para acá… Mira que hablamos español…” “Ahí están las Kardashian y Kim tiene un corset que no la deja respirar…”.

Y así, una locura frenética y divertida en la que nadie se asombra si muchos no reconocen a la pobre Carlota Casiraghi (la hija de la princesa Carolina de Mónaco) que ha entrado sola, media encogida pues tiene muy mala postura y casi nadie la fotografía ¡y la pobre chica (con su publicista muy de cerca) parecía estar perdida en medio de las escaleras…! ¡Me dio mucha pena verla…! Y es que esto es un poco ‘la ley de la selva’ porque si tienes un atuendo diferente y muy alocado, y un ‘handler’ o publicista dinámico, de seguro te retratan y hasta te entrevistan para la TV; y así vemos entrar creadores, modelos, músicos, miembros de la realeza, actores ¡y todo un “quién-es-quién” de todas las profesiones, que se apelotonan en la entrada del museo para rendir homenaje a la creatividad, la imaginación y la fama!

¿Anécdotas inolvidables?

Momentos divertidos incluyen el encuentro de ‘exes’ con sus nuevas parejas (que pretenden no verse, como si fueran transparentes). Como hace unos años el de Madonna y Kate Hudson con su ex Alex Rodríguez (¡sí, fue novio de ambas!); el de Emma Stone y su odiado exnovio Andrew Garfield; y el Amber Heard y su némesis exnovio Elon Musk.

En 1981, Yves Saint Laurent se emocionó tanto al llegar y por los vítores que recibió que se le aguaron los ojos ¡y casi se echa a llorar! Fue muy lindo. En 1996 Gianni Versace trajo a su hermana Donatella –vestida con un miniestilo sadomasoquista con cadenas y cuero negro- y dejó a todos sin saber si chiflar o aplaudir… En 1997, Karl Lagerfeld fue acompañado de Diane von Furstenberg -y estaba tan gordo, y hasta usando bastón para subir las escaleras- que años después me dijo que verse en aquellas fotos “horrendas” lo había motivado a adelgazar “tout suite”. En 1999, una casi desconocida Jennifer López entraba con su novio el rapero P. Diddy, a pocos pasos de una divertida Whitney Houston que se puso a bailar sola. ¿Curioso? En diciembre del mismo año, Jennifer y Diddy fueron arrestados en Nueva York después de un tiroteo en un club y un revólver encontrado en el auto del rapero, y la pobre chica –exonerada después de dormir en la cárcel- rompió su noviazgo con el cantante en 2001.

En otra ocasión, la modelo Gisele Bundchen llevó el vestido ¡con la etiqueta del precio colgando y a la vista de todos!…Y celebrando los recientemente 25 años cumplidos en la versión anterior de la Gala, la cantante Cher llegó con el vestido transparente que impuso moda -y le quedaba perfecto. Por supuesto, ha habido caídas estrepitosas en las escaleras, ¡igual que celebridades que no podían ni caminar con sus complicados modelos y las han tenido que cargar hasta lo alto!

Un poco de historia…

Ayudar con una recaudación de fondos al Instituto del Vestido del Museo Metropolitano –que necesita los fondos porque es el único departamento del museo que debe financiarse a sí mismo- es una idea magnífica que fundó en 1948 Eleanor Lambert, la relacionista pública de modas más famosa de Estados Unidos, fundadora también del New York Fashion Week y de la Lista de las mujeres más elegantes del mundo o International Best Dressed List. El Instituto realza la importancia de la forma de vestir en nuestra civilización y apoya a nuevos diseñadores a seguir adelante con sus carreras.

En 1973 tomó las riendas del Met Gala la icónica periodista Diana Vreeland, directora de Vogue, quien le asignó temas a cada gala, hizo la primera exhibición en honor de Balenciaga (donde conocí al príncipe Alfonso de Borbón y a su esposa Carmencita Martínez Bordiú, la nieta de Francisco Franco) y multiplicó la importancia del evento, reclutando a cientos de celebridades como Yves Saint Laurent, Bill Blass, Óscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein, Valentino, Debbie Harry, Bianca y Mick Jagger, etc. a participar en sus shows, con temas como “Romántico y glamoroso Hollywood”, “Mujeres estadounidenses con gran estilo”, “La Época de los Habsburgos”, “Los gloriosos años de la moda rusa” y muchos otros.

En 1995, la organización pasó a manos de la inglesa Anna Wintour, también directora de Vogue, quien cambió el evento al escoger temas muy originales como Heavenly Bodies: el catolicismo y la moda; Homenaje al estilo de Jackie Kennedy, Los años de Chanel; el cubismo y la moda; China Through The Looking Glass, (¡maravillosa!); el estilo punk, etc. También lo hizo un verdadero negocio al subir los precios, recibir el patrocinio de grandes corporaciones como Ralph Lauren, Versace, Prada, Dior, etc. y convirtió la noche en un evento superexclusivo al que todos quieren asistir, y para el que ella (según lo publicado por años) escoge personalmente a quién invitar y a quién no. Un toque muy ‘snob’ que enloquece a todos, ¡provocando el deseo incontrolable de ser uno de los afortunados invitados!

Las mesas que compran las grandes compañías cuestan entre US$ 200.000 y US$ 300.000 y a ellas invitan celebridades que aparecen en sus campañas publicitarias o son imagen de sus productos. La fiesta incluye ver la exposición que se inaugura esa noche y continúa siempre hasta septiembre del mismo año, una gran cena (las decoraciones de las mesas son maravillosas), seguida de un show musical de alguno de los artistas del momento, y termina en un par de horas de baile en la zona del Templo de Dendur, en el pabellón egipcio del museo. El tema de este año iba a ser “About Time, Fashion and Duration” sobre cómo el paso del tiempo afecta e influye la moda, inspirado por la novelista Virgina Woolf y las teorías del filósofo francés Henri Bergson.

(CNN) — Quaden Bayles, el niño australiano de 9 años que se ganó el apoyo de personas en todo el mundo después de haber sido víctima de acoso por su enanismo, lideró un equipo de la liga de rugby frente a miles de fanáticos que lo vitoreaban.

Bayles saltó a la cancha con el equipo Indigenous All Stars de la Liga Nacional de Rugby antes de iniciar el partido de exhibición contra los maoríes de Nueva Zelandia el sábado.

El menor había sido invitado por todo el equipo en un video publicado en línea, en el que el capitán Latrell Mitchell le dijo: “Te respaldamos. Estamos aquí para apoyarte, amigo”.

A principios de esta semana, la madre de Bayles, Yarraka, del estado australiano de Queensland, publicó un desgarrador video en Facebook para crear conciencia sobre el impacto del acoso escolar. En el video, ella reveló que su hijo había intentado suicidarse.

“Esto es lo que hace la intimidación”, dijo en el video. “¿Pueden por favor educar a sus hijos, sus familias, sus amigos?”

El video fue visto millones de veces después de su publicación el martes, y Bayles recibió una gran cantidad de apoyo de todo el mundo, tanto, que se han recaudado cientos de miles de dólares para enviarlo a Disneylandia.

Los maoríes derrotaron a los Indigenous All Stars 30-16 en el juego que tuvo lugar en el Cbus Super Stadium en la Gold Coast de Australia, y Bayles vio el encuentro desde un lado del campo.

Entre las otras caras famosas que apoyaron a Bayles estaba el actor australiano Hugh Jackman, quien publicó un video en Twitter diciéndole al niño australiano: “Pase lo que pase, tienes un amigo en mí”.

“Quaden, eres más fuerte de lo que crees, amigo”, afirmó Jackman. “Todos, seamos amables unos con otros. El acoso no está bien, punto”."

(CNN Español) — Bastaron unas horas de que se hicieran virales las imágenes de Quaden Hayles, el niño australiano de 9 años que en un video expresó sollozando que se quería suicidar por sufrir acoso en su escuela a causa de su enanismo, para que comenzaran a lloverle las muestras de solidaridad y apoyo desde muchos lugares del mundo.

Pero no solo eso, Quaden podría pasar del llanto a la felicidad gracias a la iniciativa liderada por el comediante estadounidense Brad Williams, quien también tiene enanismo, para reunir fondos a través de una campaña de GoFundMe para enviarlo a Disneyland en California junto a su madre.

“Esto no es solo para Quaden, es para cualquiera que haya sido acosado en sus vidas y le hayan dicho que no eran lo suficientemente buenos”, escribió Williams en la página de recaudación de fondos. “Demostremos a Quaden y a otros que hay algo bueno en el mundo y que lo merecen”.

La campaña de GoFundMe había recaudado hacia mediodía del sábado más de 452.000 dólares.

Los fondos serán usados para comprar los boletos de avión para Quaden y su madre de Australia a Los Ángeles. Además cubrirán gastos de hotel, comida y entradas para el parque Disneyland en Anaheim durante varios días. El dinero sobrante será donado a organizaciones dedicadas a luchar contra el bullying y el abuso, de acuerdo con la publicación.

Quaden Bayles nació con una condición llamada enanismo de acondroplasia, y se convirtió en la cara de Stand Tall 4 Dwarfism, una organización benéfica creada por su madre para crear conciencia y detener el acoso, según Seven News.

The US Food and Drug Administration yesterday granted the experimental drug emergency-use authorization to treat hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19. The decision comes just days after a government-funded study found that patients who took remdesivir recovered faster than patients who did not.

Gilead Pharmaceuticals originally designed the antiviral drug to treat Ebola, but results were disappointing. Instead, remdesivir has become the world's first authorized therapy treatment for Covid-19.

Recent weeks have witnessed a relentless quest for a viable Covid-19 treatment, with at least 72 active trials underway in the US alone. These include experiments with the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, drugs that treat arthritis and a heartburn treatment.

Still, remdesivir is not the holy grail. While it may speed up recovery from Covid-19, it does not stop people from catching the novel coronavirus. Experts have repeatedly underlined that the pandemic will not subside until an effective vaccine is widely available.

Human trials for a vaccine are under way in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany. But questions are mounting. A CNN investigation shows that the US is making a big bet on a company with unproven technology and a storied history.

YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED

Q: The flu kills more people than coronavirus. Why shut down the economy for this?

A: This is no longer true. The US death toll from coronavirus this year has exceeded 65,000, surpassing the high-end estimate for flu deaths since October.

The novel coronavirus is more dangerous than the flu for several reasons. It is much more contagious and has been killing victims at a much faster rate. The coronavirus incubation period seems much longer than that of the flu. With the flu, people typically start feeling sick one to four days after infection. For coronavirus, however, it can take up to 14 days for people to feel symptoms. The fact that it kept spreading in the southern hemisphere during its summer months suggests that, unlike the flu, warm weather won't slow its spread. Experts say many deaths could be prevented with access to existing flu vaccines. But there is no vaccine for the coronavirus.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY

India reports its biggest single-day jump in cases

Some experts say the numbers suggest the country's nationwide lockdown to halt the spread could be working, for now.

And while testing rates per capita are very low in India, experts say the country seems to be catching most of the moderate and serious cases. If a huge surge in Covid-19 cases were not being caught by testing, experts add, hospitals would be crowded with cases and there would be a spike in flu-like symptoms. That has not been the case.

India's strict lockdown measures were originally scheduled to lift Sunday, but they were recently extended for another two weeks.

White House blocks Fauci from testifying

The White House will keep Dr. Anthony Fauci , a key member of the administration's coronavirus task force, from testifying before the Democratic-led House next week, even though he is scheduled to testify in the Republican-led Senate.

The move will prevent a potential meeting between the blunt, high-ranking expert and lawmakers gearing up for an oversight battle, Jim Acosta and Caroline Kelly write . Fauci has repeatedly distanced himself from Trump's framing of the federal government's handling of the pandemic to strike a more somber tone.

He came home from hospital to die. His son kept him alive

When Suri Nathwani returned from hospital, he pleaded with his son Raj to be allowed to die at home. Death was not an outcome Raj was willing to accept, but he knew his father's chances of surviving coronavirus were not good.

Raj used a Google spreadsheet, store-bought health aids and a baby monitor to help save his dad from dying. Raj knew his father was on the road to recovery when he became strong enough to nag him. ""He began whingeing and said his tea was badly made. He then asked for some pizza and chips,"" Raj said. Tara John tells their story

http://cnn.com,Flamingos flock to a locked-down Mumbai,"(CNN) — The humans may be in lockdown in India , but tens of thousands of flamingos are making the most of the peace and quiet.

Huge numbers of the birds have flocked to Mumbai , the capital of Maharashtra state in western India, with photos of the flamingos becoming a hit with birdwatchers on social media.

The birds traditionally migrate to the area for feeding from September to the end of May, according to Rahul Khot, assistant director at the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), which monitors the flamingos.

Last year a record 134,000 flamingos were counted in the area, but Khot believes a new record will be set this year.

BNHS had already counted 125,000 flamingos before its work was disrupted by India's coronavirus lockdown measures, introduced on March 25, said Khot, who expects the population to surpass the previous record by the end of May.

It's not just the huge number of birds that's attracting attention -- they have also spread to wetlands where they were previously a rarity, added Khot.

""They are being reported from places where they have earlier been reported less in number because there is no human activity there now,"" he said.

Removing human pressure on the environment allows us to appreciate the importance of the wetlands in Mumbai, he added.

Tales of curious animals exploring towns and cities empty of humans have emerged around the world, but the phenomenon has been especially noticeable in India due to the country's normally crowded urban areas and high levels of pollution.

India has been in lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus for over a month. Trains, flights and buses are not running and only essential services are operational.

http://cnn.com,​​Liverpool: The agonizing wait for a first Premier League title,"1990 / 91 30 years of dreaming Liverpool's agonizing wait for English football’s biggest prize

Gary Gillespie doesn’t remember how he and his teammates celebrated Liverpool winning the English first division title in 1990. “We probably got together and had a few drinks and reminisced about the season,” the former Liverpool defender tells CNN, chuckling at his hazy recollection.

There was little reason to especially savor that year’s yield, Liverpool’s 18th league title and Gillespie’s third in five seasons, because winning was what the club did. Springtime in Liverpool was the season for picking up trophies.

There was satisfaction and relief, an uplift to the red half of the city after a heartbreaking decade, but not the intoxicating hit on the senses that usually comes with the glory of being the best in the land.

Liverpool, it was assumed, would do it all again in the seasons to follow, or come close at least. No one knew the 1989/90 campaign was an ending, a full stop on what had been an unforgettable sentence in English football history.

“Everybody was used to winning and maybe took it for granted, and, anytime you take anything for granted in life, sometimes it comes back and smacks you in the face,” says Gillespie, “and that’s exactly what happened because we’re talking about this 30 years down the line, and Liverpool haven’t managed to win a title since.”

This year was supposed to be different. Jurgen Klopp’s men were 25 points ahead of nearest challengers Manchester City, within two victories of winning English football’s biggest prize, before the coronavirus pandemic caused the world to pause.

As the 30th anniversary of the club’s last league title success is marked, the wait continues. Agonizing, uncertain, with the story of the club’s revival missing its final page.

‘Managed decline’

1980s Britain. Margaret Thatcher’s decade. The city of Liverpool is fighting for survival.

The docks, once the heartbeat of Liverpool's prosperity, have been in decline since the 1970s. Manufacturing is shrinking, economic stagnation is sharp, the population is in decline, inner-city homes are falling into decay and unemployment is high. The city is also the first in the UK to be hit by the heroin epidemic that will go on to wreck a generation.

“Liverpool was being forced on its knees,” lifelong Liverpool supporter and retired academic Gordon Jenkins, 61, tells CNN. “I remember Chelsea fans used to wave £20 notes at us and say, ‘we’ve got loads of money.’”

On a red-hot July day in 1981, thousands of well-wishers lined London's streets to cheerily wave Union flags in celebration of Charles and Diana's wedding in the English capital. Two-hundred miles away, Liverpool was burning. Appalling economic conditions, combined with tensions between the police and the African-Caribbean community, had exploded into anger, rapidly descending into nine days of disorder which resulted in hundreds of injuries, arrests and one death.

Widely referred to as the Toxteth Riots, locally it is known as the ‘uprising.’

“This was a city without leadership,” wrote Michael Heseltine, the cabinet minister who would go on to construct a framework to revive Liverpool, in his autobiography.

“We must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill.” Geoffrey Howe, UK finance minister, 1979-83

In the aftermath of the unrest, Thatcher’s closest ministers talked of a “managed decline” of the city, National Archives files would reveal in 2011, with Thatcher's finance minister, Geoffrey Howe, warning: ""We must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill.""

It was during this decade Liverpudlians came to see themselves as outsiders, separate from the rest of Britain. Thatcher had polarized and radicalized. A broken working-class city which, historically, had not always leaned to the political left turned red.

But during these divisive times the people had football, two of the country’s outstanding teams in Liverpool and Everton. The beautiful game gave Liverpudlians heroes and hope. Football, says Jenkins, was, and still is, “inexorably woven into the fabric of why we are who we are.”

From 1981 to 1990, the two Merseyside clubs between them won nine league titles, two European Cups, a Cup Winners' Cup, three FA Cups and three League Cups.

Liverpool Football Club had become the bastion of invincibility former manager Bill Shankly had envisaged when rebuilding the club in the 1960s. Shankly’s successors, all appointed from within, had carried the torch. Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish. Seamless successions upon which a dynasty was built.

“I was there eight years, the worst we ever finished in the league was second,” Gillespie, who left Liverpool for Celtic in 1991, says. “If you finished second it was deemed a failure, you’d had a poor season regardless of what else you’d won.""

The league title was, says Gillespie, the ""be all and end all” and this was especially the case in the latter half of the decade when English clubs were indefinitely banned from European competition following the Heysel disaster in 1985.

“We never got allowed to get carried away,” Gillespie says, identifying the camaraderie formed on boozy nights out as one of the reasons for the club’s success.

“The coaching staff were always calling us ‘big heads’ and any opportunity they had they would try to knock you down. There was never too much praise for us. I don’t think we needed it.

“When we came in after games, we would have to tie our boots so it was easier for the coaching staff to put the boots away. When we took our kit off, we just didn’t throw it on the floor; we had to put the shorts in a pile and the tops in a pile. It was little things like that that kept you grounded.”

A city grieving

Though football saved the city during this decade, it was also the source of unimaginable pain.

On April 15, 1989, Liverpool fans were crushed to death on the Leppings Lane terrace in Hillsborough, Sheffield, during an FA Cup semifinal. Ninety-six men, women and children unlawfully killed, an inquest would find 28 years later, due to police failings and the criminal gross negligence of the officer in command.

Players had watched the injured and dying being carried away on advertising hoardings used as emergency stretchers and, in the weeks that followed, provided solace for the grieving. At one stage, the 38-year-old Dalglish, by now Liverpool’s player-manager, attended four funerals a day.

Adding to the suffering were the false accusations, published on the front page of the Rupert Murdoch-owned English newspaper ‘The Sun’ immediately after the disaster, that Liverpool fans had urinated on police and pickpocketed dead victims.

“It [the disaster] left its mark on a lot of people,” says Gillespie, conceding that the players still do not like to talk about the tragedy.

At the start of that year, defending league champions Liverpool had been in an unfamiliar position: fifth in the league and nine points behind leaders Arsenal. And, so, the second half of the season was spent in relentless pursuit of the Londoners, with Liverpool eventually bumping Arsenal from the summit with two games remaining thanks to 21 wins in 24 games. Yet the championship was not yet won. The end-of-season title-decider was still to come.

Arsenal’s April visit to Anfield had been rescheduled to the final day of the season because of the Hillsborough disaster, resulting in the jittery Londoners arriving on Merseyside needing to beat their rivals, who six days earlier had won the FA Cup, by two goals to become champions.

No one expected Arsenal to win but this Friday night match under the lights was made legendary as soon as the final whistle blew. In a hallucinatory ending, with seconds remaining and the visitors 1-0 ahead, Arsenal's Michael Thomas burst from midfield and scored, securing an extraordinary 2-0 win -- and the championship -- for the Gunners.

At the final whistle, television cameras capture Dalglish standing silently near the Liverpool dugout, looking into the middle-distance.

“When Arsenal score, you can see a lot of them (Liverpool players) collapse to the floor. They were playing three games a week; they’d been going to all the funerals, and there was a sense that a lot of them were exhausted,” says Gordon.

Business as usual

For those who witnessed it, the 1988/89 season finale lives strong in the memory. But when Liverpool's players returned to pre-season training four weeks later, no one at the club mentioned the Arsenal defeat, or even the previous campaign.

“The coaching staff, the manager, the whole ethos of the club was to never look back, to never linger, regardless of whether you had won the title or lost it. It was just something that was ingrained in us,” Gillespie explains.

“To win the championship after a heartbreaking decade ... it was a remarkable achievement.” Gordon Jenkins, Liverpool fan

Liverpool’s only major signing that summer was Swedish defender Glenn Hysen, bought from Fiorentina for £600,000 ($670,472).

The new season started with an eight-match unbeaten run, including a 9-0 thumping of Crystal Palace, but this was not a particularly dazzling Liverpool vintage. A 4-1 loss to Southampton led to an indifferent patch and, while Liverpool ended the year topping the table, by March Aston Villa had the initiative.

Meet the 1989/90 squad

Yet Villa stuttered. A home loss to Manchester City was followed by a 3-3 draw with Norwich City and, as any seasoned predator would, Liverpool capitalized. On April 28, 1990, having that day beaten QPR 2-1 at Anfield, Liverpool regained the title.

“To win the championship after a heartbreaking decade … it was a remarkable achievement,” says Gordon.

“We’d been so successful for so long, to say we took it for granted wasn’t quite the case because it was always a great privilege to be a Liverpool supporter, [but] it was like normal service being resumed.”

Relief for a job well done

The smartphone, let alone a wireless network, was still some years from being part of everyday life, so it was left to Anfield’s stadium announcer to inform fans that Liverpool had won a sixth championship in 10 years.

Attending his first Anfield match that day was a seven-year-old John Gibbons. As Liverpool's players walked around the pitch to acknowledge the fans -- Bruce Grobbelaar, the club's idiosyncratic goalkeeper, performing handstands -- Gibbons remembers standing on a seat and serenading the champions to 'You'll Never Walk Alone.'

“It was all fairly understated,” Gibbons, a contributor to the Anfield Wrap podcast, tells CNN. “It was exciting, it was good, but if you’d told anyone in that ground that it would be 30 years until they’d win the next one, they wouldn’t have believed you.”

For the players, soaking up the pressures of expectation was over until the next season at least. “You put 10 months on hold, you give your all for 10 months,” says Gillespie. “Fortunately for us we were normally successful, but I don’t think you can enjoy it [a season].”

English football goes global

But at the beginning of the hedonistic 1990s, Liverpool would learn that even great clubs cannot pause to catch a breath. As Shankly once said: ""Football is relentless ... it goes on and on like a river.""

On the morning of February 22, 1991, with three months remaining of the 1990/91 season, photographers, TV crews and journalists had assembled at Anfield.

The city’s newspaper, the Liverpool Echo, had already prepared its front page because it knew what was to come: Dalglish, with Liverpool three points clear at the top of the table, was going to resign as Liverpool manager.

“Kenny Dalglish as a person has pushed himself to the limit,” said the Scot during the news conference, flashbulbs lighting up his face.

As a Liverpool player, Dalglish had won three European Cups, five league titles and four League Cups and added three more league titles and two FA Cups, including a league and cup double, as player-manager.

But this was a man who had taken on the city’s grief.

In a recent documentary about the man regarded as Liverpool’s greatest player, his family talked of the impact Hillsborough had on him: sleepless nights, mood swings, a rash covering his body, the struggle to make simple decisions.

He had also taken charge of the team shortly after 39 Juventus fans had died before the Italian club’s European Cup final against Liverpool in the Belgian city of Brussels. Supporters, the youngest just 11 years old, killed in a stampede before kick-off in the dilapidated Heysel stadium. It had all taken its toll.

“It all started going wrong when Kenny left,” says Gillespie.

The cracks, which arguably had first appeared when the team suffered an FA Cup semifinal loss to Crystal Palace in 1990, deepened. Celebrated players came to the end of their careers and new manager Graeme Souness made unsuitable, expensive signings.

Thirty miles away great rivals Manchester United were readying to dominate English football’s new age. The birth of the Premier League in 1992 led to a boom: wealth, glitz and the globalization of the English game. Successful on the pitch, United flourished commercially.

This is Anfield: The history of an iconic stadium Opened in 1884, Anfield was originally home to Liverpool’s city rivals Everton, who moved out in 1891. A year later, newly-formed Liverpool started to play there. The stadium, which has four stands, has become one of football’s most iconic venues. In 1906, the famous Spion Kop was constructed. It was converted into an all-seater stand in 1994. Around the stadium there are nods to the club’s past, such as The Shankly Gates, The Paisley Gateway and The Hillsborough Memorial. The Main Stand, built in the 19th century, has been redeveloped in the last decade, boosting Anfield’s capacity to 54,074.







In an interview with English newspaper The Guardian in 2002, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who would guide the Old Trafford club to 13 league titles, uttered a now famous sentence.

His greatest challenge, he said, was “knocking Liverpool right off their f***ing perch.”

With 20 league titles to Liverpool’s 18, the Manchester club can still crow, but United are not the dominant force they once were.

Back on their perch?

Some fans have been known to request selfies on the Kop with Chris Bolland, once they learn how long the 63-year-old has been attending matches at Anfield. A familiar face in the stands since 1966, he remembers plenty of title wins. But neither of his two sons have experienced the joy of watching the team lift a championship trophy.

The family has experienced close calls over the last three decades – second-place finishes under Rafael Benitez and Brendan Rodgers, and last season's astonishing 97-point haul which was eclipsed only by Manchester City -- but during those seasons Liverpool weren't unquestionably the best. Fans dreamed, but never fully believed.

This season, however, Klopp’s men have dropped just five points. Never has a team negotiated a season in England’s top flight in such a relentless, uncompromising manner.

Postponed indefinitely because of the pandemic, no one knows with certainty when or how English football will resume. If the Premier League season were unable to be completed, would Liverpool be denied the championship? For now, that is the unanswered question.

The nervousness which rumbled around Anfield at times last season as the team vied with Manchester City in one of the closest title races in recent memory – though they lost only once, Liverpool missed out on the title by a point – had vanished this season.

Winning the European Cup in Madrid last June, Klopp’s first major trophy as Liverpool manager, had strengthened the fans' faith in the players. They believed. But anxiety increases in uncertain times.

Joy Bratherton, 64, moved to Liverpool in 1974 to be nearer Anfield. Once just one of the few female faces among a crowd of thousands on the Kop, she was enduring sleepless nights even before a global pandemic stopped Liverpool's charge to the league title.

Whether Liverpool will win the Premier League is, she says, ""the first thing I think of in the morning and the last thing I think of in the nighttime.""

""I am having very mixed dreams when I doze off,"" she adds, speaking to CNN days before the UK was put into lockdown. ""The strain and stress of the last two seasons has been overpowering.""

It was after comfortably beating Manchester United in January that the first chants of “we’re going to win the league” echoed around Anfield. A new banner also popped up in the stands at the beginning of the year with the sentence, “This Bird Is Getting Back On Its Perch.”

But the deaths and suffering caused by coronavirus have changed perspectives. Dreams of winning a first league title in 30 years are no longer all-consuming.

“You’ll Never Walk Alone is not just a song, it’s not merely an anthem, it’s a statement of intent.” Gordon Jenkins, Liverpool fan

""Not being able to be crowned champions for the foreseeable future is completely irrelevant. It absolutely doesn’t matter,"" says Jenkins.

""Jurgen Klopp, who is Bill Shankly reincarnated, has said football is the most important of the least important things and that just nails it completely. 'You’ll Never Walk Alone' is not just a song, it’s not merely an anthem, it’s a statement of intent. It’s not just about Liverpool people, it’s about people generally."
http://cnn.com,Verona van de Leur: The star gymnast who reinvented herself as a porn actress,"(CNN) The simple act of cartwheeling at the age of five begins Verona van de Leur's story, a childhood passion which in turn led to a desire to be an Olympic gymnast.

In the intervening three decades, she became a Dutch national treasure known for her sporting prowess.

But injury curtailed her career and her life spiraled out of control. Locked out of the family home, she says she spent two years homeless and endured a fractious legal battle with her father.

Things got even worse when she was imprisoned, convicted of blackmail in 2011. She says she came within seconds of stepping in front of a train to end her life.

She says redemption came working as a porn actress and, now at the age of 34, Van de Leur has penned her autobiography, laying out details of her life.

She is adamant there are no regrets. Of her foray into the adult movie industry, which she says she stopped last year, Van de Leur told CNN Sport's Don Riddell: ""Actually no regrets because I was living on the streets ... I would still do it, so I don't have any regrets, not the way I did it, no.""

Engrossed by watching gymnastics at the 1996 Olympics, she set her heart on competing at the Games. The medals followed, with silver both at the World and European Championships. She was named Dutch sportswoman of the year in 2002 just before turning 17.

Hide Caption 6 of 7 Photos: Verona van de Leur's life and times She says that despite the family fallout and contemplating suicide, she had found happiness in life. Hide Caption 7 of 7

Lisa Deen, who works as a freelance sports journalist specializing in gymnastics, describes Van de Leur as ""one of the greatest gymnasts in the Netherlands' history.""

'Left with a black hole'

To start with, Van de Leur loved the life of being a gymnast.

""It's quite strange but it's also fun of course -- I mean you're a teenager and everybody's watching you in a good way, asking for an autograph, so it feels special, of course,"" she says.

""Your parents are proud, your family's proud, everybody's talking positive about you. But you have all the pressures coming and you have to succeed at the next competition again and again.""

Trying to pinpoint when things began to unravel is hard for Van de Leur.

Van de Leur quit gymnastics in her early 20s.

At times, she thinks it could have been as early as the age of nine when she took up gymnastics competitively.

What's not in doubt is that the downward spiral started in 2003 following an injury. Suddenly, Van de Leur says, she had nothing.

""If I look back, it's just a sport, a hobby you're good at,"" she says. ""But at the time it was printed in my head, 'This is what you are. You are only a gymnast'. And for me there was no life besides it ... For the people around me, I was only that robot, only the gymnast and I didn't have friends.

""So, if your sport is falling apart, there's nothing left so you have this black hole.""

Van de Leur says her falling out of love with gymnastics reached its peak in 2008 when she announced to the media at the European Championships that she was walking away from the sport that had defined her life. She was just 22.

Her first reaction was happiness it was finally over, and for once she felt like she was taking control of her own life. However, when she told her parents, she says they remonstrated with her, concerned Van de Leur was turning her back on potential earnings.

In her opinion, their attitude was that ""money was more important than their own daughter."" Around that time, she returned to the family home only to discover she was no longer welcome, she says.

'Locked out of home'

CNN tried to contact Van de Leur's father for comment via email, phone and social media but proved unsuccessful, as well as her sister.

""I tried the locks, I had a key as I was living there and you try it and it's not working,"" Van de Leur recalled. ""You first think, well, it must be a mistake or I'll just call home. They didn't answer, they didn't open and then I realized I wasn't welcome anymore.""

So, she slept in her car with her boyfriend that night, first annoyed and then heartbroken that her family had rejected her. She says, ""The last time I saw them was in court.""

A court summary of the case says Van de Leur argued that in 2008, her father, who acted as her agent, ""withdrew an amount of €9,000 ($9768) from the claimant's payment account without the consent or knowledge of the claimant, of which only part of the claimant was repaid or related to costs incurred on behalf of the claimant.""

She added: ""I've asked for the accounting and where's my sponsorship money and all the money I get from gymnastics when I won and it was just all gone. The only thing was to get justice to go to court so that's what I did.""

An attorney listed as Van de Leur's father's lawyer at the time declined to comment to CNN citing code of conduct.

The court summary states that Van de Leur's father argued that he had ""incurred costs including moving the claimant's personal property out of her trainer's home, buying gifts for the trainer and her family, replacing locks in the defendant's home and staying with family related to potential threats.""

However, in February 2009, a court of The Hague ordered her father to pay her €1,355.89 ($1471) as well as allow Van de Leur to return to his home to retrieve a number of items: a sunbed, tracksuits and leotards, and various presents, and to stop running a website in her name.

Reflecting on facing her parents in the court room, Van de Leur said: ""From the beginning, I know I lost everything and money doesn't get parents back.""

Verona van de Leur's gymnastics career stalled after an injury.

'I wasn't used to showing myself nude'

For two years after her family fallout, she says she was homeless. During that time, Van de Leur was arrested for trying to blackmail a couple having an extra marital affair -- she was charged with extortion -- which resulted in her spending 72 days in prison.

""In that time, being homeless, I didn't care anymore how I got money for food,"" she said.

""But even in that worst situation I know it was not my right to determine the law and, yes, I regret that I didn't choose or find another option in that period of time. Maybe it's good for me that I have been punished for 72 days to realize I was wrong, and I was.""

When out of jail, the adult industry -- first as a webcam model and then making videos with her boyfriend -- seemed a good way out. The couple is still together 13 years on.

""I saw it as a chance,"" said Van de Leur. ""It was a big contract so I could build something, starting my business. I was starting as a webcam model. It wasn't physical contact, so computer screen was okay. I wasn't used to showing myself nude, of course.""

The reaction in Holland to her dramatic career change, she says, was mixed, but having been homeless and in jail, Van de Leur saw her new job as offering her a fresh start.

""I didn't say at the time I lived on the street or where I was coming from but for me this was actually a step up and they only saw that I was going down,"" she said. ""So, I kept it in my mind, it's my life, it's what I like to do and I always saw it as work.""

Van de Leur also made a return to the gymnastics world at the World Championships in Stuttgart last year where she worked as an analyst for the Dutch media, but she returned home prematurely before the event had finished.

As she reflects on the various twists and turns of her life, Van de Leur says she wishes she had been smarter at a younger age when her gymnastics career was taking off.

Above all these days she wants to embrace life -- having come so close to ending it all.

It was amid the dispute with her family, that Van de Leur says she went to a railway line to kill herself.

""I went to the train and I was just counting from 10 to zero and I didn't jump,"" she recalled. ""I don't know why but it was really the moment that it could be all over.

""I was thinking about my family that I lost, I was living on the street, I had nothing, nothing to eat, no money in my hands, so I had nothing to live for.

""That was what I was thinking at that moment but, when the train just passed, I don't know something snapped maybe. I still don't know why I didn't jump, I was crying and then just walked away.""

Now, Van de Leur says that moment gives her strength and that she's learned to ""enjoy every moment of her life."""

http://cnn.com,Leadership lessons: How sailing can make you a better leader,"(CNN) Leadership lessons pop up in all aspects of life but skippering a sailing yacht offers a glimpse of the deep end.

With weather, wind and waves to contend with, a crew to cajole and keep safe, navigation to be worked out, and an expensive boat to maintain, strong leadership is a must.

Racing ups the ante and the stress levels. The skipper must also ensure the boat is being sailed fast, the crew are motivated, and strategic decisions are made quickly and decisively.

""You're effectively playing chess on water and you're managing risk all the time,"" said Britain's Ian Walker, who is a double Olympic silver medalist and Volvo Ocean Race-winning skipper.

Sailing is an adventure, but it can be dangerous, with myriad hazards at play, from nature and the sea, to bone-crunching equipment and human error. Team work is a must, and that starts with the skipper.

Unlocking potential

Tracy Edwards , the first person to skipper an all-female crew in the then Whitbread Round The World Race, believes squeezing the best out of a crew is perhaps the most vital skill to have as a leader. After all, it's the crew that ultimately wins races.

""I think understanding what motivates each person within your team is an extraordinary piece of knowledge,"" Edwards told CNN Sport. ""It enables you to do so much.""

She learned a valuable early lesson from her skipper on a trans-Atlantic voyage from Antigua to Portugal. The young Edwards was tasked with learning the navigation system, a feat that seemed impossible at first. Despite initial doubts, she mastered the art and says her skipper's belief unlocked her potential.

""With good leaders there's that innate understanding of how to get the best out of people and how to inspire them,"" said Edwards, whose 1989 Maiden challenge is the subject of a recent film.

Democracy vs. dictatorship

Skippers need to adopt different leadership styles, says Edwards.

Edwards believes being able to adopt different leadership styles, depending on the situation, is something that sets the best skippers apart.

""At first, you've got this amazing team of people that you've picked and you want it to be a democracy because you want them to give you their knowledge,"" she added.

However, such an approach simply doesn't work in critical conditions or in life or death situations, when the crew is looking for clear directions.

""If you faff around you're endangering people's lives so that really taught me that even if you're wrong, sound very determined about it,"" she said, remembering a time during the Whitbread where her team were battling through huge seas and howling winds.

""But then of course when you get it wrong, you have to admit it afterwards.""

Instilling confidence

Ian Walker says good leaders need to be able to deal with conflict.

Adopting a confident front is vital for the skipper of an elite boat, says Walker, who won his first Olympic medal at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.

Going into the 2000 Games in Sydney, Walker was the senior member of his two-man Star boat and knew his partner Mark Covell was feeding off his apparent confidence.

""It was very important that he believed I knew what I was doing,"" Walker told CNN Sport. ""Quite often, I didn't know what I was doing or at the very least I was questioning what we were doing.""

Despite growing concerns that they weren't fast enough and weren't going to ""deliver on the biggest stage"", he continued to shoulder the burden and hide his insecurities. However, just weeks ahead of the competition, Walker began to crack and was faced with a decision that faces all leaders. Does he continue with the facade or tell his teammate the truth?

""I just had to open up and get rid of that burden because it was making us sail worse,"" admitted Walker, who went on to secure a second silver medal.

""In the end, I couldn't carry it on because the integrity side came out.""

Humble and transparent

For Dutch sailor Carolijn Brouwer, a three-time Olympian and the first female winner of the Volvo Ocean Race alongside Frenchwoman Marie Riou, there are two keys to good leadership.

""A good leader is someone who is humble,"" Brouwer, who is set to become the first woman at the helm of an America's Cup challenger, told CNN Sport in an interview from her home in Sydney, Australia. ""And the best leaders are also those that are able to show their vulnerability.""

Carolijn Brouwer (center) and the DongFeng Race Team won the 2017-2018 Volvo Ocean Race.

Much like Walker opening up about his doubts, Brouwer remembers a time during the race where her skipper Charles Caudrelier demonstrated impressive levels of communication.

""He was doubting himself, he didn't think he was good enough for the team. As a result, he didn't eat or sleep properly, and got irritated,"" she told CNN Sport from her home in Sydney, Australia.

""But the beautiful thing was that he told us about it, he was very direct about it, which meant he gave us the chance to help him with that.

""And that's very important. You can't do everything completely in the right way all the time. And the fact that you are strong enough to show your vulnerability, giving people the chance to help you, and you solve the problem, is what makes you a strong leader.""

After working through his vulnerabilities, the team went on to win the Volvo Ocean Race -- not because they were the best sailors but because they were ""the best team,"" said Brouwer.

Taking responsibility

Walker thinks good skippers are able to adopt to different leadership styles.

According to Walker, leadership qualities can manifest themselves in different ways.

""You can have very authoritarian leaders who are very charismatic but then there are those quieter leaders who are every bit as much leaders,"" he said.

""They have a different way of getting the maximum out of their team.""

But no matter how good a team is, there will always be disagreement. Dealing with such conflict under extreme pressure is part and parcel of skippering a large yacht in the Volvo Ocean Race.

In his second Volvo Ocean Race in 2011, Walker was faced with a critical decision when his boat suffered damage in the Southern Ocean. Half of his crew wanted to continue around Cape Horn off the southern tip of South America, while the other half wanted to retire to Chile.

The decision rested with Walker, and he made the call to head to Chile, but he had to work hard to appease the members of his team that wanted to carry on.

""It was important that I listened to everybody and then I made a decision on what I thought was the best decision for everybody,"" said Walker, who is now director of racing for the British sailing team.

""It was about transparency, about being decisive and not wavering.

""I've always been able to make decisions, I'm not afraid of taking responsibility."""

(CNN) ""Look, we're going to lose anywhere from 75, 80 to 100,000 people. That's a horrible thing. We shouldn't lose one person out of this."" With that, President Donald Trump substantially revised his own estimate of how many Americans could die from the coronavirus (though White House officials have projected up to 240,000 deaths).

During a Fox News town hall last night at the Lincoln Memorial, Trump praised his administration's response to the outbreak and admitted that Covid-19 had been more dangerous than he expected — though he offered support to people protesting against lockdowns and insisted it was safe for states to reopen.

Now that more than half of states have loosened or let go of their stay-at-home orders, experts expect fatalities to jump this summer. A statistical model often cited by the White House increased its prediction for the number of fatalities by August, partially because of measures lifted prematurely.

Just how deadly an ""inevitable"" second wave will be depends on how prepared the US is, Dr. Anthony Fauci, America's top infectious disease expert, said.

Fauci warned that lifting measures too early could lead to a rebound of the virus and might put the country back in the ""same boat that we were a few weeks ago.""

Q: Lockdowns are lifting where I live, but is it safe for me to venture outside?

But if you are reentering public spaces, it's important to do it safely.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY

Report: China ""intentionally concealed"" severity of virus

The Chinese government intentionally concealed the severity of the coronavirus from the international community while it stockpiled imports and decreased exports, a Department of Homeland Security report found, according to an administration official familiar with it.

The report, which assessed export and import data earlier this year, comes as the Trump administration formulates a long-term plan to punish China on multiple fronts for the pandemic, injecting a rancorous new element into a critical relationship already on a steep downward slide.

How America's largest city deals with its dead

Ananda Mooliya reassured his wife and two sons that he was fine, though they could hear his labored breathing from the next room over the sound of the TV. His wife made soup for him. Moments later, he died. Several hours would pass before his body was lifted off the floor and taken to a morgue — and it was nearly three weeks before his cremation.

The handling of Mooliya's body isn't unusual in these times. Coronavirus deaths have overwhelmed New York City's health care workers , morgues, funeral homes, crematories and cemeteries. On the day Mooliya died, there were 799 Covid-19 deaths in the state of New York — a one-day high. To date, the state has recorded more than 24,000 deaths, most of them in NYC.

Though the city doubled to about 2,000 its capacity to store bodies, funeral homes are still turning down cremations because they can't hold onto them. Cremations are delayed to mid-May and beyond. Bodies rest in refrigerated trailers in funeral home parking lots. Burials are backed up.

Europe enters ""phase 2"" of reopening

Italy, the worst hit country in Europe, is entering phase two of reopening, after eight weeks in lockdown. Italians will now be able to travel within regions to visit relatives and ""significant"" relations (e.g. boyfriends, girlfriends and lovers) on a limited basis, so long as they wear masks, and up to 15 people will be allowed to attend funerals. More than 4 million Italians will be back to work, as factories and building sites resume activities — but schools, hairdressers and many other commercial activities remain closed.

It's not only Italy — today marks a move toward normality for several EU countries. Shops are reopening in Greece, many schools are welcoming back students in Germany, and public transport will be allowed, with mandatory face masks, in Belgium.

Meanwhile, the British government is deflecting questions over the country's death toll, which is now the second worst in Europe after Italy.

Neighboring countries consider ""travel bubbles""

Australia and New Zealand are discussing the possibility of opening up borders to each other, creating a travel corridor — or ""travel bubble"" — between the two countries, after both appeared to successfully bring their outbreaks under control.

While some experts say the approach could become a model for the rest of the world, others aren't so sure. Germany's interior minister is not taking up neighboring Austria's offer to welcome holidaymakers, telling Bild am Sonntag newspaper it was too early to lift border restrictions.

Japan's ""internet cafe refugees""

Odd jobs on construction sites used to earn Takahashi enough money to pay for a private booth at one of Tokyo's internet cafes — between $17 and $28 per night. But Japan's lockdown not only cost him his work, it has temporarily closed the cafe that was his de facto home, and left him sleeping rough at a Tokyo bus terminal.

Now, Japanese authorities are providing emergency housing to support those like Takahashi, who were living in internet cafes. But the pandemic measures have exposed a problem that goes back decades.

http://cnn.com,Michael Jordan: 'The Last Dance' seems to have created a bull market in former NBA star's Nike sneakers,"(CNN) If stocks have taken a pounding over the last few weeks, there has been a bull market raging in Michael Jordan's range of Air Jordan sneakers.

In episode five of the blockbuster 10-part documentary series, ""The Last Dance"" we see Jordan nearly turn down Nike as his sponsor, potentially missing out on a billion-dollar opportunity.

The conception of the Air Jordan line of sneakers is also documented, and in what the basketball star thought would be his final ever appearance at Madison Square Garden, Jordan laces up a pair of his first signature sneakers: the Air Jordan 1 ""Chicago,"" a shoe that was 13 years old at that point in 1998.

It's a trainer that has been coveted by sneakerheads ever since the ex-Chicago Bulls star wore them in his rookie year -- and it's only been rereleased a handful of times, most recently in 2015.

And while prices on the resale market for this sneaker have always been buoyant, they have shot up since first episode of ""The Last Dance"" aired.

http://cnn.com,الفيفا: 5 تبديلات لكل فريق خلال مباريات كرة القدم لضمان سلامة اللاعبين,"رغم توقف بث المباريات بسبب فيروس كورونا.. عالم الرياضة يحاول الاستفادة من الوضع الراهن

دبي، الإمارات العربية المتحدة (CNN)-- أعلن الاتحاد الدولي لكرة القدم (فيفا)، الجمعة، تعديلا مُؤقتا في قوانين اللعبة، وذلك بهدف حماية سلامة اللاعبين في غضون تفشي فيروس كورونا المستجد (كوفيد 19).

ويأتي إقرار مجلس الاتحاد الدولي للتعديلات تزامنًا مع دراسة استئناف بعض المسابقات الكروية في جميع أنحاء العالم، في فترة ما بعد جائحة كورونا.

وبالنسبة للمسابقات التي بدأت أو من المقرر أن تبدأ، لكن من المقرر أن تكتمل بحلول 31 ديسمبر كانون الأول، وافق مجلس الفيفا على اقتراح بإدخال تعديل مؤقت بموجبع سيُسمح بإجراء 5 تبديلات كحد أقصى لكل فريق خلال المباريات.

ولتجنب تعطل اللعبة، ستتاح لكل فريق ثلاث فرص فقط لإجراء التبديلات. ويمكن إجراءها أيضًا بين الشوطين.

ويدخل التعديل حيز التنفيذ اعتبارًا من 1 يونيو حزيران المقبل، وسيظل ساريًا وفقًا لتقدير كل منظم للمسابقات، بينما سيحدد الفيفا في مرحلة لاحقة ما إذا كان هذا التعديل المؤقت سيحتاج إلى مزيد من التمديد، وذلك بالنسبة للمسابقات الممتدة حتى 2021.

كما سيسمح لحكام المباريات بالتوقف مؤقتا عن الاعتماد على تقنية ""الفار"".

وجاءت تفاصيل التعديل المؤقت الخاص بتبديل اللاعبين على النحو التالي:

- سيُسمح لكل فريق باستخدام 5 تبديلات كحد أقصى.

- لتقليل تعطل المباراة، ستتاح لكل فريق 3 فرص كحد أقصى لإجراء الاستبدالات أثناء المباراة، ويمكن إجراءها أيضًا بين الشوطين.

- إذا قام كلا الفريقين بإجراء استبدال بين الشوطين، فسيتم اعتبار ذلك كإحدى الفرص الثلاث لكل فريق.

- يتم ترحيل التبديلات والفرص غير المستخدمة إلى الوقت الإضافي.

- عندما تسمح قواعد المنافسة باستبدال إضافي في الوقت الإضافي سيكون لكل فريق فرصة استبدال إضافية واحدة. ويمكن أيضًا إجراء الاستبدالات قبل بدء الوقت الإضافي وبين الشوطين الإضافيين."

http://www.time.com,How to Make a DIY Face Mask for Coronavirus,"Amid a shortage of medical-grade face masks, such as surgical masks (loose-fitting, disposable masks that block large droplets but don’t filter small particles) and N95 respirators (tight-fitting face coverings that filter out small particles), the U.S. federal government recently changed its recommendations, suggesting now that all residents wear homemade facial coverings when they have to go out.

That’s a marked difference from previous federal guidance that recommended only sick people or those caring for someone who is sick wear face masks. According to newly updated guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, anyone who is around other people should cover their mouth and nose with a cloth face cover, which the health agency says can be made from household items or common materials found at home. That, in turn, has raised questions about how people can best make their own face coverings at home, whether by sewing cloth masks or fashioning something out of bandanas or other fabric.

Wearing cloth face masks while in public can help prevent a person from potentially transmitting an infection to someone else. “If everybody wears a mask, it can prevent asymptomatic carriers from inadvertently infecting other people because it can trap the virus inside the mask,” says Dr. Larry Chu, a professor of anesthesiology at the Stanford University Medical Center. “That can help prevent the spread.”

However, the CDC and health care professionals have noted that cloth facial coverings are not a substitute for other preventative measures. Everyone should continue frequently washing their hands and maintaining social distancing practices, in conjunction with wearing face masks in public spaces.

Here is a basic guide to making your own face masks. Tested by TIME staff, the sewing instructions are based on guides provided by Deaconess Health and the Medical College of Wisconsin and Froedtert Hospital.

For those who sew

Materials

2 pieces of 100% cotton fabric that measure about 7 inches by 9 inches—cotton T-shirts, dish towels and pillowcases are good options (make sure all fabric is washed and dry)

2 pieces of cotton fabric that measure about 1.5 inches by 40 inches for the mask’s strap (in a pinch, you can use something like shoelaces or ribbon)

A ruler, sewing pins, a pair of scissors, thread, an iron and a sewing machine

Instructions

Step 1: Sew the two main rectangle pieces together with the “right” sides of the fabric—the side you want to see—facing each other. Sew almost all the way around the rectangles, leaving a small gap (a few inches) open on the long side.

Step 2: Turn the rectangle right-side-out by reaching into the gap you left open and pulling the fabric through. Now your edges are on the inside and you have a neatly sewn two-sided rectangle. At the gap you left open, just tuck the edges inside for now; you’ll sew it closed later.

Step 3: Make three evenly spaced pleats along both 7-inch sides of the fabric, making sure to keep all of your tucks facing in the same direction, and pin in place. One way to do this is by marking the spacing with pins: place one about 1.5 inches down the short side of the fabric; add the next 1 inch down from that, then the third ½ inch down from that, and keep alternating between 1 and ½ inches until you’ve used all six pins. To create the pleats, just bring the first pin down to meet the second, the third to meet the fourth, and the fifth to meet the sixth. Repeat on the other side.

Step 4: Once the pleats are pinned, stitch all the way around the perimeter of the rectangle. This will sew the pleats into place and also close the gap you had left open in Step 1.

Step 5: If you’re using a strip of fabric for your strap, fold and iron it in half lengthwise and then fold and iron the raw edges in. Find the centers of your straps and the centers of the long sides of your mask, and match them. Pin the straps in place along the long edges of the mask, so there is a strap on the top of the mask and one on the bottom, with equally long pieces coming out to the sides. If you’re using a strip of fabric, pin it so it’s wrapped around the edge of the rectangle.

Step 6: Sew the strap to the mask by stitching all the way down each strap, catching the edges of the mask as you pass. (If you are using a strap that did not require folding, you can opt instead to stitch around the perimeter of the rectangle one more time.)

For those who don’t sew

You can also make cloth face masks out of T-shirts or bandanas. The instructions for no-sew masks are based on a guide from the CDC and a tutorial from Japanese Creations.

Materials for a T-shirt face mask

A T-shirt (preferably made of cotton or another breathable material)

Scissors

A ruler

Instructions

Step 1: Cut off the bottom 7 inches of the T-shirt

Step 2: The detached T-shirt bottom will make a two-layered rectangle. Cut a smaller rectangle across 6-7 inches of the width of the material. The remaining fabric will make up the face covering and the strings to the mask.

Step 3: To attach the mask, cut the middle of the fabric strips to make strings and tie one set behind your neck and the other behind the back of your head (depending on the size of the T-shirt and your face, you may have to cut out more material to ensure the mask fits—cut as much or as little as you need to properly cover your mouth and nose openings).

Materials for a bandana face mask

A bandana or a square cotton cloth

Two hair ties

Instructions

Step 1: Lay the bandana flat

Step 2: Fold the top of the bandana to the middle

Step 3: Fold the bottom of the bandana up to the middle so it meets the top

Step 4: Flip the bandana over and fold the top and bottom to the middle again

Step 5: Flip the bandana over again and thread the ends through both hair ties, dividing it into thirds

Step 6: Fold the sides of the bandana in so the hair ties form outer loops that you can put behind your ears.

Flip it once more, so the pleats are facing outward, and the mask is complete.

http://www.time.com,How to Make a DIY Face Mask for Coronavirus,"Amid a shortage of medical-grade face masks, such as surgical masks (loose-fitting, disposable masks that block large droplets but don’t filter small particles) and N95 respirators (tight-fitting face coverings that filter out small particles), the U.S. federal government recently changed its recommendations, suggesting now that all residents wear homemade facial coverings when they have to go out.

That’s a marked difference from previous federal guidance that recommended only sick people or those caring for someone who is sick wear face masks. According to newly updated guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, anyone who is around other people should cover their mouth and nose with a cloth face cover, which the health agency says can be made from household items or common materials found at home.
